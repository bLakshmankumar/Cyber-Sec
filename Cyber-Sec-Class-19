# Started the CyberSecurity & SOC:
=====================================
Definition : 
------------
  Cybersecurity is a field focused on protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, breaches, attacks, and other cyber threats. 
  Its purpose is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and computing resources.

SOC : 
-----
It's a dedicated site or room where security analysts will sit and will monitor and whenever any incidents will come, SOC team will take care of incident investigation or Forignsic analysis.

Soc another names :
--------------------
  CERT : Computer Emergency Response Team
  CSIRT : CyberSecurity Incident Response Team
  SIRT : Security Incident Response Team
  Cyber Defence Center
  Blue Team 

Levels or Tiers in SOC :
------------------------
  A Security Operations Center (SOC) typically operates with multiple tiers or levels of personnel, each responsible for specific functions and tasks within the cybersecurity operations. 
  These tiers ensure that incidents and alerts are effectively managed, investigated, and escalated as needed. While the exact structure may vary depending on the organization's size, complexity, and requirements, a common model includes three primary tiers:
  
   Tier 1 - Analysts (Level 1):
   ----------------------------
     Role:  Tier 1 analysts are the frontline responders in the SOC. They are responsible for monitoring security alerts, triaging incidents, and performing initial investigations to determine the severity and scope of potential threats.
     Tasks: Tier 1 analysts review alerts generated by security monitoring tools, analyze log data, and conduct basic correlation and analysis to identify potential security incidents.
            They follow predefined procedures and play a crucial role in filtering out false positives and escalating legitimate threats to higher tiers.
     Skills: Tier 1 analysts require strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and knowledge of common security threats and attack vectors. 
             They should also be proficient in using security tools and technologies, such as SIEM platforms, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
  
   Tier 2 - Engineers (Level 2):
   -----------------------------
     Role: Tier 2 engineers provide deeper analysis and investigation of security incidents escalated from Tier 1. They focus on understanding the root cause of incidents, conducting more advanced forensics, and developing remediation strategies to contain and mitigate threats.
     Tasks: Tier 2 engineers investigate and analyze escalated incidents in greater detail, correlating data from multiple sources to identify patterns and trends. 
            They may perform network traffic analysis, malware analysis, and memory or disk forensics to determine the extent of a breach and develop response plans.
     Skills: Tier 2 engineers require a strong understanding of cybersecurity concepts, including threat intelligence, malware analysis, and incident response methodologies. 
             They should have expertise in using advanced security tools and techniques and possess strong problem-solving and communication skills to collaborate effectively with other teams.
  
   Tier 3 - Managers (Level 3):
   ----------------------------
     Role: Tier 3 managers provide oversight, leadership, and strategic direction for the SOC. They are responsible for coordinating incident response activities, managing SOC operations, and ensuring alignment with organizational goals and objectives.
     Tasks: Tier 3 managers oversee the overall functioning of the SOC, including incident prioritization, resource allocation, and performance monitoring. 
            They develop and maintain SOC policies, procedures, and playbooks, and collaborate with stakeholders to enhance the organization's security posture.
     Skills: Tier 3 managers require a broad understanding of cybersecurity governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) frameworks. They should have strong leadership, communication, and decision-making skills, 
             as well as the ability to anticipate emerging threats and develop proactive security strategies.
