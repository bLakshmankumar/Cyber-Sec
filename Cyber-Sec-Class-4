OSI LAYER :  (Open Systems Interconnection) 
===========================================
   It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), In 1984
   Refers to a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into 7 abstraction layers. 
   Each layer serves a specific purpose, and the framework helps guide the design and development of network protocols and systems.
Example:
--------
   If a user cannot access a website, the OSI model allows systematic analysis. Is it an issue with the physical connection (Layer 1), the routing of data (Layer 3), or perhaps a problem with the web browser (Layer 7)?

    1           Application-layer(LAYER-7)        The top layer handles network services directly interacting with end-users.                           DATA                            OWASP TOP 10 ATTACKS

                                                  Function: Provides network services directly to end-users or applications.
                                                  WEB-BROWSING PORTS :  HTTPS(443), HTTP(80),
                                                  MESSAGE PORTS: SMTP(25), FTP(21), POP3(POST-OFFICE-PROTOCALS)(110), IMAP(143).
                                                  FILE TRANSFER PROTOCAL : We can sent a file from one server to another server by using FTP Ports(20 & 21).
                                                

    2           Presentation Layer (Layer-6)      Responsible for data translation and encryption/decryption.                                            DATA                              
                                                  It ensures that data is presented in a readable format and
                                                  handles data compression and encryption.
