OSI LAYER :  (Open Systems Interconnection) 
===========================================
   It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), In 1984
   Refers to a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into 7 abstraction layers. 
   Each layer serves a specific purpose, and the framework helps guide the design and development of network protocols and systems.
Example:
--------
   If a user cannot access a website, the OSI model allows systematic analysis. Is it an issue with the physical connection (Layer 1), the routing of data (Layer 3), or perhaps a problem with the web browser (Layer 7)?

Layers :

 Layer Num            Layer-name                                   Description or Feature of the layer                                    PDU(Protocol Data Unit) or Data Format             Attacks

    1           Application-layer(LAYER-7)        The top layer handles network services directly interacting with end-users.                           DATA                            OWASP TOP 10 ATTACKS 
                                                  It Uses for Provide or Get the information, Here we use https,http protocals                                                          MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK(MITM)
                                                  Function: Provides network services directly to end-users or applications.                                                            SANS TOP 25
                                                  WEB-BROWSING PORTS :  HTTPS(443), HTTP(80),
                                                  MESSAGE PORTS: SMTP(25), FTP(21), POP3(POST-OFFICE-PROTOCALS)(110), IMAP(143).
                                                  FILE TRANSFER PROTOCAL : We can sent a file from one server to another server by using SFTP Port 22 and FTP(20 & 21).
                                                  DNS(53), DHCP(67 from laptop side & 68 from server side port). For assigning the Dynamic IP address DHCP server will use DORA Process.
                                                  SSL/TLS(443).
                                                

    2           Presentation Layer (Layer-6)      Responsible for data translation and encryption/decryption also Encodeing and Decoding.                DATA                            OWASP TOP 10 ATTACKS                    
                                                  It will convert data from one format to another format.                                                                                MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK(MITM)
                                                  It ensures that data is presented in a readable format and handles data compression and encryption.
  
    3           Session Layer (Layer 5)           It'll Basically Manages and establishes communication sessions between applications.                    DATA                           OWASP TOP 10 ATTACKS 
                                                  It'll also manages the Authentication and Authorization.                                                                               HIJACKING
                                                  It sets up, maintains, and terminates connections, coordinating data exchange.                                                         
    
    4           Transport Layer (Layer 4)         Manages end-to-end communication Without any error and data flow control.                               Segments/Datagrams              TCP, UDP, DDOS, DOS, ARP, SYN                                           
                                                  It ensures reliable and error-checked delivery of data, 
                                                  often through protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
