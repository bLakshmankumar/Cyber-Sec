OSI LAYER :  (Open Systems Interconnection) 
===========================================
   It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), In 1984
   Refers to a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into 7 abstraction layers. 
   Each layer serves a specific purpose, and the framework helps guide the design and development of network protocols and systems.
Example:
--------
   If a user cannot access a website, the OSI model allows systematic analysis. Is it an issue with the physical connection (Layer 1), the routing of data (Layer 3), or perhaps a problem with the web browser (Layer 7)?
