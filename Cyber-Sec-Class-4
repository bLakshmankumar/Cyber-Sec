OSI LAYER :  (Open Systems Interconnection) 
===========================================
   It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), In 1984
   Refers to a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into 7 abstraction layers. 
   Each layer serves a specific purpose, and the framework helps guide the design and development of network protocols and systems.
Example:
--------
   If a user cannot access a website, the OSI model allows systematic analysis. Is it an issue with the physical connection (Layer 1), the routing of data (Layer 3), or perhaps a problem with the web browser (Layer 7)?

Interview Qns for OSI Layer :
=============================
1) Data Encryption and decryption or encoding or decoding comes under which layer :
       ANS > Presentation Layer (Layer-6).

2) What is DOS and DDOS :
       ANS > DOS(Distributed ) : A DoS attack aims to make a service, network, or website unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic, disrupting normal functioning.
             Example :  Sending a large volume of traffic to a website, causing it to become slow or unresponsive, and denying service to legitimate users.
             DDOS(Distributed Denial of Service): A DDoS attack is an amplified version of a DoS attack, involving multiple compromised devices (a botnet) to flood a target with traffic simultaneously.
             Example : Coordinating a large number of infected computers to send massive amounts of traffic to a target, overwhelming its resources and causing a service outage.
                Key Differences:
                   Source of Attack:
                      * In a DoS attack, a single source overwhelms the target.
                      * In a DDoS attack, multiple sources (a botnet) coordinate the attack.

3) what is tcp 3 way handshake with example ?
       ANS > The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) three-way handshake is a process that establishes a reliable and orderly connection between two devices. 
              # 3 ways are : 
               ------------
                  SYN (Synchronize)
                  SYN+ACK (Synchronize+Acknowledge)
                  ACK (Acknowledge)
             Client (A): Sends a TCP segment with the SYN flag set to Server (B).
             Server (B): Receives the SYN, sends a TCP segment with both SYN and ACK flags set to Client (A).
             Client (A): Receives the SYN-ACK, sends a TCP segment with the ACK flag set to Server (B).
      The Client will initate the connection using SYNCORNIZING(SYNC) request, Server will respond back with SYNK+ACK and finaly client will respond back with acknoldegemnet.
      The Entire process is happening in 3 ways. That's why this is called tcp 3 way handshake.

4) What is tcp 2-way hand-shake ?
       ANS > TCP Two-way handshake in the context of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) typically refers to a simplified interaction between a client and a server where they exchange acknowledgment messages.
              Example of a TCP Two-Way Handshake:
                 * Client Sends Request:
                        The client sends a TCP segment with a request to the server. This request could be a simple message or a data packet.
                 * Server Acknowledges:
                        The server receives the request and sends back a TCP segment acknowledging the receipt of the client's message.
                        This acknowledgment may not include a separate response; it merely confirms the successful reception of the client's data.

     This two-way exchange is less common than the traditional three-way handshake used during the establishment of a TCP connection. 

5) Difference Between TCP 3 Way & 2 Way Handshake :
     The three-way handshake involves the following steps: SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge), and ACK (acknowledge).
     The three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection and ensures both parties are ready to exchange data.
     While the two-way handshake example provided is simplified and not a standard TCP connection setup, it illustrates a basic acknowledgment of communication between a client and a server. 
     In real-world scenarios, the three-way handshake is the standard for establishing reliable connections in TCP.

6) What is TCP-5 way Handshake ?
       Tcp 5-Way Handshake = TCP 3-Way Handshake + TCP 2-Way Handshake.

7) Diff Between TCP & UDP ?
                               TCP(Transmission Control Protocal)                                                                                                          UDP( User DataGram Protocal)

  It's a Connection-Oriented Protocal that ensures reliable, ordered data delivery with a three-way handshake.                 It's Connectionless protocol that provides fast but unreliable data transmission without handshaking.
  It's Guarantees data delivery, retransmitting lost packets, and ensuring ordered delivery.                                   It Does not guarantee delivery or order, making it suitable for real-time applications like video streaming. 
  It's Suitable for applications requiring reliable and ordered data delivery, such as web browsing and email.                 It's Suitable for real-time applications, including video streaming, VoIP, and online gaming, where low latency is essential.
  Here The data format is segment                                                                                              Here Data Format is DataGram
  TCP is Slower than UDP                                                                                                       UDP is Faster then TCP
  EX : TCP used for Accessing Websites, Servers, DB and End User system.                                                       EX : UDP used for Video calls, Gaming, Drive Downloads.

8) Why UDP Scan is so difficult ?
      Because it's a connectionless & Stateless protocal, it's not using any ping command, and it's not using any icmp protocal and so on.
      Also UDP does not involve a three-way handshake, making it less susceptible to detection during a scan.
      Also UDP does not provide acknowledgment of receipt. 
      Scanners cannot rely on receiving a response from the target system, making it harder to confirm the state of a UDP port.
  
9) Why UDP is faster than TCP ?
      UDP does not require a three-way handshake, reducing initial delays, and is suitable for real-time applications where low latency is crucial, such as online gaming or live streaming.
      Also UDP has less protocol overhead compared to TCP, as it lacks features like flow control, error recovery, and acknowledgment, making it more lightweight.

10) One of the server or one of the Server/protocal supports both TCP & UDP Connections/ Which Server/Protocal is using TCP & UDP Connectinons ?
      DNS Server/Protocal

11) Router and ARP will comes under which layer ? 
      Router & ARP comes under Network layer.

12) Purpose of Traceroute Command ?
      It is used to trace the route that how packets take from a source to a destination on a network.
      Ex : traceroute/tracert google.com 
      In this example it'll list all available routers From my laptop to google.com(destination) with how much time each router will take to process the request between each router.

13) What are the routing protocals and purpose ?
      Routing protocols are algorithms or sets of rules used by routers to determine the best paths for forwarding network traffic.
      Different routing protocols serve specific purposes based on the network's requirements.

      Routing Information Protocol (RIP):
      ----------------------------------
      Purpose: RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol used within small to medium-sized networks. It measures the distance to other routers in the network based on the number of hops.
      It'll work if num of <15 hops only, if routers are >=15 between source and destination this protocal doesn't work.
      
      Open Shortest Path First (OSPF):
      --------------------------------
      Purpose: OSPF is a link-state routing protocol designed for larger, more complex networks. It calculates the shortest path to a destination based on the network's topology.

      Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):
      ------------------------------
      Purpose: BGP is used for routing between autonomous systems (ASes) on the Internet. It focuses on policy-based routing and is essential for interconnecting different Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
      BGP Protocal works for internet, Ex on my mobile i have jio and airtel sim, if my jio sim lost the network signals, my mobile will go for airtal network automatically.
    
     Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP):
     --------------------------------------------------
     Purpose: EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol that combines features of both distance-vector and link-state protocols. It is suitable for medium to large-sized networks.
     It's Dedicated to single location, Ex if you are office is located on Bangalore it's work on that location only.

     Routing Information Protocol Next Generation (RIPng):
     -----------------------------------------------------
     Purpose: RIPng is an extension of RIP designed for IPv6 networks. It uses similar principles to RIP but supports the IPv6 addressing scheme.

     Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP):
     -----------------------------------------
     Purpose: IGRP was a Cisco proprietary routing protocol used in older networks. It has been largely replaced by EIGRP.

     Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP):
     ------------------------------------------
     Purpose: RTMP is a routing protocol used in AppleTalk networks. It facilitates the exchange of routing information between AppleTalk routers.

     Statis & Dynamic Router Protocals :
     -----------------------------------
     Static routing involves manual configuration, making it suitable for smaller and more stable networks. 
     Dynamic routing utilizes protocols to automate the exchange of route information, making it adaptable and scalable for larger and more dynamic networks.
