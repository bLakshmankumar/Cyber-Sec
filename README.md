   # Here User want to send a request to Printer, So Switch will take the request from user and it'll forward the request to printer(destination) through router and Load Balancer.
   # But Here attacker will compromise the Switch, so Whenever the user sends a request, The request will go to swith and redirect to attacker system, Then he will give some malicious response to the user.
   # Once user click on the attacker link the system will get compromised/Attacker will gain a unauthorized access.

   # A user attempts to access their online banking website by entering the domain name (e.g., www.bankexample.com) into their web browser.
   # The attacker, who has infiltrated the network or compromised DNS servers, intercepts the DNS resolution process and responds to the user's request with a spoofed DNS response.
   # Instead of receiving the legitimate IP address of the bank's website, the user's device is directed to an attacker-controlled server hosting a fake banking website.
   # The user, unaware of the spoofing attack, enters their login credentials into the fake website, unwittingly providing them to the attacker.
   # The attacker captures the user's login credentials and may use them for unauthorized access to the user's bank account or for identity theft purposes.
   # In this example, the attacker successfully manipulated the DNS resolution process to redirect the user to a malicious website, exploiting their trust in the DNS infrastructure to carry out fraudulent activities.
