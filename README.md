# Cyber-Security-Class-10 :
===========================
# Backend Process of ARP Spoofing Attack :
------------------------------------------
   # Here User want to send a request to Printer So Switch will take the request and it'll forward the request to printer(destination) through router and Load Balancer.
   # But Here attacker will compromise the Switch so When user sends a request The request will go to swith and redirect to attacker system, Then he will give some malicious response to the user.
   # Once user click on the attacker link the system will get compromised/Attacker will gain a unauthorized access.
