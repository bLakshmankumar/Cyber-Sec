# EndPoint Protection (or) EndPoint Security :
# ============================================

What is Endpoint : Please refer microsoft doc for detailed info -: [ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-an-endpoint ]
------------------
Endpoints are physical devices that connect to and exchange information with a computer network. Some examples of endpoints are mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
Internet-of-Things devices—like cameras, lighting, refrigerators, security systems, smart speakers, and thermostats—are also endpoints. 
When a device connects to a network, the flow of information between, for instance, a laptop and a network, is much like a conversation between two people over the phone.

What is EndPoint Security:
--------------------------
Endpoint security refers to the protection of individual devices or endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and servers, from cybersecurity threats. 
Endpoint security typically involves installing software agents or applications on endpoint devices to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, 
detect and respond to security threats, and enforce security policies.
It involves securing the endpoint devices themselves, as well as the networks and data they access, to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, and other cyber attacks.

Importance of endpoint security:
--------------------------------
Endpoint security, or endpoint protection, helps protect endpoints from malicious actors and exploits.

How endpoint security works:
----------------------------
Endpoint security uses a range of processes, services, and solutions to protect endpoints from cyberthreats. 
The first endpoint security tools were traditional antivirus and antimalware software designed to stop criminals from harming devices, networks, and services.
Endpoint security has since evolved to include more advanced, cloud-powered, and comprehensive solutions that help detect threats, investigate, and respond to threats, and manage apps, devices, and users.

Common endpoint security risks:
-------------------------------
Organizations are increasingly vulnerable to endpoint security threats as more workforces become more mobile. Some of the more common endpoint security risks include:
  * Phishing : It's a type of social engineering attack that manipulates targets into sharing sensitive information.
  * Ransomware: It's a malware that holds victim’s information until a sum of money is paid.
  * Device loss: It's one of the leading causes of data breaches for organizations. Lost and stolen devices can also lead to costly regulatory fines.
  * Outdated patches:  which expose vulnerabilities in systems, creating opportunities for bad actors to exploit systems and steal data.
  * Malware ads, or malvertising : which uses online ads to spread malware and compromise systems.
  * Drive-by downloads: It's the automated download of software to a device without the user’s knowledge.

Endpoint security best practices:
---------------------------------
  * Educate users: Employees are the first line of defense in endpoint security. Keep them informed with regular security and compliance training, and alerts.
  * Track devices: Keep track of all devices that connect to your network. Update your inventory frequently. Make sure endpoints have the latest software updates and patches.
  * Adopt Zero Trust: Support a Zero Trust security model. Manage and grant access with continual verification of identities, devices, and services.
  * Encrypt endpoints: Strengthen security with encryption, which adds another layer of protection to devices and data.
  * Enforce strong passwords: Require complex passwords, enforce regular password updates, and prohibit the use of old passwords.
  * Keep systems, software, and patches updated: Conduct frequent updates of operating systems, application, and security software.

Endpoint security solutions: 
----------------------------
   * Endpoint Detection and Response(EDR): EDR solutions continuously monitor endpoint activities and behaviors to detect suspicious or malicious behavior indicative of cyber threats. 
                                           They provide real-time threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities to mitigate security incidents.
    
     NOTE : Below all are separete solutions for Endpoint securities, now *EDR Tool* is capable of all these below solutions.

     * Antivirus and Anti-malware Software : These solutions scan endpoint devices for known viruses, malware, spyware, and other malicious software. 
                                             They use signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral monitoring to identify and remove threats from endpoints.
   
     * Endpoint Encryption: Encryption solutions encrypt data stored on endpoints and transmitted over networks to protect it from unauthorized access and interception. 
                            They use encryption algorithms to secure sensitive information and prevent data breaches in case of device theft or loss.
    
     * Patch Management: Patch management solutions automate the process of identifying, deploying, and managing software patches and updates on endpoints. 
                         They ensure that operating systems and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of exploitation by attackers.
    
     * Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): A NGFW is a security appliance that processes network traffic and applies rules to block potentially dangerous traffic.
                                        NGFWs evolve and expand upon the capabilities of traditional firewalls.They do all that firewalls do, but more powerfully and with additional features.
     
     * File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) : FIM examines operating system files, Windows registries, application software, and Linux system files for changes that might indicate an attack.
          Which files should I monitor? : Please Ref this Document [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-overv].
     
     * Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP is a set of tools and procedures that forms part of a company’s overall security strategy,
                                and focuses on detecting and preventing the loss, leakage, or misuse of data through breaches, exfiltration transmissions, and unauthorized use.

-------------------
    Whenever any abnormal/Malicious/Suspicious activity will happened in the endpoint level using drive by downloads, Phishing email attachments, Removable devices,
    Then the EDR Agent will communicate with AV/EDR tool, Based on the policies configured and detection methods, Either it'll BLOCK, ALLOW, or Clean or Quarentain.


Backend Detection Methods of EDR tool for EndPoint security:
=============================================================
      * Behavioral Analysis: Behavioral analysis techniques analyze endpoint behaviors and activities to identify deviations from normal patterns or expected behavior.
                             EDR tools monitor processes, system calls, registry changes, file activities, network connections, and other endpoint events to detect malicious activities such as fileless malware, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.
      
      * Signature-based detection: It's a method used by security tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, to identify known threats by comparing digital signatures or patterns of malicious code against a database of known signatures. 

Deployment:
-----------
   We have two types of deployments 1) On-premise(Datacenter) or Physical Hardware Device,  2) SAAS(Cloud)
