# EndPoint Protection (or) EndPoint Security :
# ============================================

What is Endpoint : Please refer microsoft doc for detailed info -: [ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-an-endpoint ]
------------------
Endpoints are physical devices that connect to and exchange information with a computer network. Some examples of endpoints are mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
Internet-of-Things devices—like cameras, lighting, refrigerators, security systems, smart speakers, and thermostats—are also endpoints. 
When a device connects to a network, the flow of information between, for instance, a laptop and a network, is much like a conversation between two people over the phone.

What is EndPoint Security:
--------------------------
Endpoint security refers to the protection of individual devices or endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and servers, from cybersecurity threats. 
Endpoint security typically involves installing software agents or applications on endpoint devices to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, 
detect and respond to security threats, and enforce security policies.
It involves securing the endpoint devices themselves, as well as the networks and data they access, to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, and other cyber attacks.

Importance of endpoint security:
--------------------------------
Endpoint security, or endpoint protection, helps protect endpoints from malicious actors and exploits.

How endpoint security works:
----------------------------
Endpoint security uses a range of processes, services, and solutions to protect endpoints from cyberthreats. 
The first endpoint security tools were traditional antivirus and antimalware software designed to stop criminals from harming devices, networks, and services.
Endpoint security has since evolved to include more advanced, cloud-powered, and comprehensive solutions that help detect threats, investigate, and respond to threats, and manage apps, devices, and users.

Common endpoint security risks:
-------------------------------
Organizations are increasingly vulnerable to endpoint security threats as more workforces become more mobile. Some of the more common endpoint security risks include:
  * Phishing : It's a type of social engineering attack that manipulates targets into sharing sensitive information.
  * Ransomware: It's a malware that holds victim’s information until a sum of money is paid.
  * Device loss: It's one of the leading causes of data breaches for organizations. Lost and stolen devices can also lead to costly regulatory fines.
  * Outdated patches:  which expose vulnerabilities in systems, creating opportunities for bad actors to exploit systems and steal data.
  * Malware ads, or malvertising : which uses online ads to spread malware and compromise systems.
  * Drive-by downloads: It's the automated download of software to a device without the user’s knowledge.

Endpoint security best practices:
---------------------------------
  * Educate users: Employees are the first line of defense in endpoint security. Keep them informed with regular security and compliance training, and alerts.
  * Track devices: Keep track of all devices that connect to your network. Update your inventory frequently. Make sure endpoints have the latest software updates and patches.
  * Adopt Zero Trust: Support a Zero Trust security model. Manage and grant access with continual verification of identities, devices, and services.
  * Encrypt endpoints: Strengthen security with encryption, which adds another layer of protection to devices and data.
  * Enforce strong passwords: Require complex passwords, enforce regular password updates, and prohibit the use of old passwords.
  * Keep systems, software, and patches updated: Conduct frequent updates of operating systems, application, and security software.

Endpoint security solutions: 
----------------------------
   * Endpoint Detection and Response(EDR): EDR solutions continuously monitor endpoint activities and behaviors to detect suspicious or malicious behavior indicative of cyber threats. 
                                           They provide real-time threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities to mitigate security incidents.
    
     NOTE : Below all are separete solutions for Endpoint securities, now *EDR Tool* is capable of all these below solutions.

     * Antivirus and Anti-malware Software : These solutions scan endpoint devices for known viruses, malware, spyware, and other malicious software. 
                                             They use signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral monitoring to identify and remove threats from endpoints.
   
     * Endpoint Encryption: Encryption solutions encrypt data stored on endpoints and transmitted over networks to protect it from unauthorized access and interception. 
                            They use encryption algorithms to secure sensitive information and prevent data breaches in case of device theft or loss.
    
     * Patch Management: Patch management solutions automate the process of identifying, deploying, and managing software patches and updates on endpoints. 
                         They ensure that operating systems and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of exploitation by attackers.
    
     * Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): A NGFW is a security appliance that processes network traffic and applies rules to block potentially dangerous traffic.
                                        NGFWs evolve and expand upon the capabilities of traditional firewalls.They do all that firewalls do, but more powerfully and with additional features.
     
     * File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) : FIM examines operating system files, Windows registries, application software, and Linux system files for changes that might indicate an attack.
          Which files should I monitor? : Please Ref this Document [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-overv].
     
     * Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP is a set of tools and procedures that forms part of a company’s overall security strategy,
                                and focuses on detecting and preventing the loss, leakage, or misuse of data through breaches, exfiltration transmissions, and unauthorized use.

Backend Detection Methods of EDR tool for EndPoint security:
=============================================================
      * Behavioral Analysis: Behavioral analysis techniques analyze endpoint behaviors and activities to identify deviations from normal patterns or expected behavior.
                             EDR tools monitor processes, system calls, registry changes, file activities, network connections, and other endpoint events to detect malicious activities such as fileless malware, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.
      
      * Signature-based detection: It's a method used by security tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, to identify known threats by comparing digital signatures or patterns of malicious code against a database of known signatures. 

      * ML/AI Detections: MI/AI algorithms analyze the behavior of endpoint devices and users to establish baseline patterns of normal behavior.
                          ML or Deep Learning ia very usefull For new or Unknown category of attacks and Behavioural analysis.

      * Hash Value Method: The backend hash value detection method used in EDR tools for endpoint security involves comparing cryptographic hash values of files or processes on endpoint devices against known good or malicious hash values stored in threat intelligence databases.
        Prevention : Every file has a Unique hash value, Take the Hash value from the file and go to EDR tool, and block using hash value method. In future if similar type of hash value of the file of the malware entering it'll block it automatically.
        Where we can see the Hash-value of the file : For example we can check on virustotal.com and upload the file and you can see the Hash value of the file.

      * Baseline detection method: Every organization will define a Threshold value of CPU, Memory, RAM. Like If CPU or RAM Utilization is cross 70%, Whenever the enduser machine crossed that threshold value, Automatically alerts will trigger on EDR tool.
                                   Then we have to take the file which is consuming more Bandwidth, CPU, RAM, Then we should start investigation using virustotal.com or Sandboxing Environment.

      * heuristic approach: Heuristic analysis observes the behavior of files, processes, and system activities on endpoint devices to identify patterns or behaviors that deviate from normal or expected operations.
                            This method is applicable to malicious scripts, If attacker is trying to injecting or sending malware scripts through phishing, or Drive Downloads or maybe removable devices. 
                            EDR tool will scan and identify those malware scripts are present or not on the end user system.

      * Sandboxing Environment: It's a testing environment, every organization will maintain and also it'll feed threat intelligencies on daily basis. In real time we are not test malware files/Urls/emails on #rd party websites like virustootal.com & etc.
                                because if attacker already compromise the virustotal.com and if we are upload any file/url/email then they can steal our information. So That every organization is using a internel testing envirnment for security.
                                A sandboxing environment in endpoint security refers to an isolated and controlled environment where suspicious files, applications, or processes can be executed and analyzed safely to determine their behavior and potential threat level.
                                Sandboxing helps prevent cyber attacks by allowing security analysts to inspect and assess potentially malicious content without risking damage to the production environment. 
                                 
Deployment:
-----------
   We have two types of deployments 1) On-premise(Datacenter) or Physical Hardware Device,  2) SAAS(Cloud)

Exceptons & Exclusions:
=======================
    Exceptions or Exclusions we have to do it on EDR admin tool.
    If you want to exclude the file from scanning Copy the file path (Ex: prgramfile/users/username/Test.txt). Even we can exclude the HASH value from EDR tool.
    once we exclude the file/hash value on EDR tool, then anyone can download or access that file, there is no blocking from EDR tool for activity.
