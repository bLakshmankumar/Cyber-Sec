Cyber-Security Course Content for Soc Operations : 
==================================================

Topics :
--------
1) Networking Concepts (It's related to computer networks ex : LAN, WAN, MAN(metro area netwrok).
----------------------
     Inside this network concept we have some sub concepts
        > OSI Layer Approach (Open system Interconnection). 
           ( Here we have 7 layers approach and it'll comepletely explain about back-end communication between the servers )
        > TCP/IP Layer Approach 
           ( Here we have 4 layer concept ) 
        > IP Address & Classification of IP addresses Concepts [ Ip address is ntg but a 32 bit octa 4 decimal unique identification number for a device in a network ].
             Ex wew have this ip : 198.89.98.1 = 32 bit.
            [ Ex : 198.89.98.1 : 4 decimals, Each and every decimal is an octa, and Octa value is 8, So how many decimals we have totally 4(8+8+8+8)= 32 bits.]

            Classification/Types of IP Address : By using this we can identify whether some perticuler hacking belongs from internal employ side or extrenal hacker side.
        > DNS/DNS Records (Domain name system/server)
        > Static IP and Dynamic IP (Dynamic Host configuration protocla(DHCP) (In the org level for evey laptop every desktop we use dynamic ip so the dynamic address allocation done by using DHCP server).
        > Ports & Protocals (Protocal is ntg but a rules and regulations we use ports for communication purpose protocal represents the type of port)
          [ Ex : Port(80) & Protocal(Http)].
        > Network architecture diagram 
        > TCP Flags, TCP Packets, IP Packet [ Whenever we want to enable any communication we should enable the flag, For enable flag we can call true condition = 1 For desable flag we can call false condition = 0,
           and all communiccation will flow using ip packets only]
        > Servers [ We have multiple couple of servers in the org like DNS-SERVER, DHCP-SERVER, SMTP-SERVER, DB-SERVER, APP-SERVER, FILE-SERVER, WINDOWS SERVER, LINUX-SERVER 7 etc)]
          These servers will be used by different teams across the company.
       
        > *Network and CyberSecurity* : (Important Topic) ( we are going to discuss 45 attacks)

2) EndPoint Security/EndPoint Protection :
------------------------------------------
     In the EndPoint Security we are going to discuss these below topics.
       > AntiVirus or EDR (Ntg but a next generation Antivirus)
       > DLP (DATA Loss or DATA leak prevention
       > FIM (File integrity monitoring)
       > HIDS/HAPS (Host  Intrusion Detection System, Host Intrusion Prevention System)
       > Encryption ( Encryption Data at Rest )

3) Network Security : ( This we will use entire WAN/LAN level in an Organization for network security)
---------------------
     In This Network Security we will going to discuss these below topics.
       > FireWall (Also we can call it as a Next Generation Firewall(NGFW).
       > Proxy Server
       > NIDS/NIPS (Network IDS / Network IPS)

4) Application Security :
-------------------------
     In This Application Security we will going to discuss these below topics
       > SDLC LifeCycle ( Here we are going to discuss about sdlc life cycle, Basically this sdlc life cycle is done by developers).
          Under SDLC Lifecycke we have requirement phase, Design phase, Development Phase, Testing Phase finally Release & Operation Phase.
       > WAF (Web Application FireWall)
       > OWASP TOP 10 (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) (TOP 10 IS explain about top 10 attacks).
       > Penetration Testing (Security Testing) [Here we check any security bug/issue is involved]
       > Cryptography (It ntg but a masking, in simple words logical reasoning using some computer algorithms).(Ex if we want to download sensitive data like bank statement, 
          they are using this technique to encrypt the data by using cryptography controlls.(Simpy it's a logical reasoning and mathematical operations.

5) Server security(Infra Security) : (Vulnarability management)
------------------------------------
  Eaither physical servers/Virtual(cloud) servers. We will run a scan on all these servers for identify any security bug/issues are existing. These issues will fix by respective teams like windows team. linux team. operations team & etc.


6) Cloud-Security :
-------------------
 Cloud Security comes under Cloud-providers like GCP, AWS, AZURE & etc.

7) Information Security :
-------------------------
 In This Information Security we will going to discuss these below topics
 Whenever we are refering the Information security it's called GRC(Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance).
       > GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance, It's like an security auditing).
           There are 2 types of security auditings
               1) Finance Audit     2) Security Audit(here security team will verify all the policies, regulations, rules as per central, state government.)
       > ISO 27001 ( international standard to manage information security).
       > BCP/DR (Business Continuety Planning and Desaster Recovery)
       > Incident Response

8) Cyber Security SOC : [security operations center]
-----------------------------------------------------
   Simply Security Monitoring we can call it as a SOC. For this SOC we use this below tool.
       > SIEM (Security Infromation and Event Management)
            Inside this one we have different levels (L1, L2, L3, L4)
                 L1 : Cyber Security Analyst/ Security associate (0-4 Years)
                 L2 : Senior Information analyst. (4-6 Years)
                 L3 : Threat Hunters, Malware analysis Team (7+ Years).
                 L4 : SOC Manager

Additional Tools :
==================
  We will use some additional tools either Open-Source Tools or Commercial Tools for forensic analysis and incident investigation.
     OpenSource Tools :
     ------------------
               > MX Tool
               > Ip Void
               > Ip abuse DB
               > Hybrid Analysis.com
               > virustotal.com
               > Mytrie Framworks *(Very Very Important)
               > Cisco Talos
               > Wire Shark
               > Nmap
               > OSINT
               > Process Monitor
               > Process Explorer
     
     Commercial Tools : 
     ------------------
              > IBM Qrader-SIEM or SPLUNK
              > Fortigate
              > Sophos Editor(Endpoint Security)
              > Service Now
              > Nessus (Vulnerability Management).
