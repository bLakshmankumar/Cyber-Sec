Port :
=====
  It's a Software defined number associated to each and every protocal. Port can be used for send and recieve the communication.
  It also helps to manage network traffic by directing data to the appropriate application or service running on a device.
  Common ports include:
    Port 80: Used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
    Port 443: Used for HTTPS (HTTP Secure).
    Port 21: Used for FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
    Port 22: Used for SSH (Secure Shell).
    Port 25: Used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

Protocal : 
==========
  A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received in network communication.
  Protocols provide a standardized way for devices to communicate with each other. They specify the format of data packets, the sequence of actions during communication, and error handling procedures.
  Common protocols include:
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable, connection-oriented communication.
    UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers fast, connectionless communication without error checking.
    IP (Internet Protocol): Manages addressing and routing of data packets.
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for web page retrieval.
    FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between devices.

Relationship b/w Ports & Protocals :
====================================
  A port number is often associated with a specific protocol. For example, HTTP typically uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443. The combination of a port number and a protocol allows devices to communicate effectively.

 Examples:
 --------
  If you are accessing a secure website (HTTPS), your device communicates using the HTTPS protocol over port 443. The combination of the protocol and the port ensures that the data reaches the correct application on the server.

Simply: 
=======
  Ports are specific endpoints on a device, and protocols are sets of rules governing how devices communicate. Ports are associated with protocols, and together they facilitate the effective exchange of data between devices on a network.

Types of Ports:
===============
  In the context of networking and cybersecurity, "open ports" and "closed ports" refer to the state of accessibility of network ports on a device.   
  We have Two types of Ports
   1) Open Ports       2) Closed Ports

    Open Ports:
    -----------
       Meaning: An open port refers to a network port on a device that is actively listening for incoming connections. 
                It means that a service or application is running and ready to accept communication requests on that particular port.
                Open ports are accessible to network traffic, and they allow communication with the associated service or application.
                Services such as web servers, email servers, or file transfer services often require open ports to function properly.
      Security Considerations:
                While open ports are necessary for legitimate services, having unnecessary open ports can pose a security risk.
                Unprotected services or misconfigurations might expose a system to potential attacks. It's important to regularly audit and monitor open ports for security purposes.
    Closed Ports:
    ------------- 
      Meaning : A closed port is a network port on a device that is not actively listening for incoming connections.
                It means that there is no service or application currently running and waiting for communication on that specific port.
                Closed ports do not respond to incoming connection attempts. 
                When a device receives a request on a closed port, it typically responds with a "Connection Refused" message, indicating that there is no service running on that port.
     Security Considerations:
                Closed ports, especially those that are not associated with necessary services, contribute to a more secure network environment. 
                They reduce the attack surface and limit potential entry points for unauthorized access.

How to Check Port Status:
=========================
    Port Scanning:
    -------------
      Network administrators often use port scanning tools to check the status of ports on a device. 
        Port Scanning tools :
        ---------------------
           Include Nmap(Network mapper), Netcat, Kali Linux, Metaspolit or online port scanning services.

   Firewall Configuration:
   ----------------------
      Firewalls play a crucial role in controlling which ports are open or closed. Configuring firewalls to allow only necessary traffic and closing unnecessary ports is a key security measure.

   Network Monitoring:
   -------------------
      Continuous network monitoring helps identify unexpected changes in port status and potential security issues.

       SNMP Versions:
       --------------
       SNMP has different versions, with SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 being the most widely used.

         1) SNMPv1 (Simple Network Management Protocol version 1):
         ---------------------------------------------------------
             Original version of SNMP.
             Limited security features.
             Uses community strings for authentication, which are sent in plaintext, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.

         2) SNMPv2c (Simple Network Management Protocol version 2, Community-based):
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Improved upon SNMPv1.
             Introduced the concept of SNMP communities.
             Still lacked strong security features.

         3) SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management Protocol version 3):
         ---------------------------------------------------------
             SNMPv3 is more secure compared to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.

             Addresses security shortcomings of previous versions.
             Provides message encryption, authentication, and access control.
             Uses a more robust security model compared to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.
             Recommended for secure network management.
30) SMB :
---------
      SMB, which stands for Server Message Block, is a network protocol used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between devices on a local network.
      SMB operates at the application layer of the OSI model and facilitates communication between computers over a network. 
      The protocol has undergone various versions, with the most common being SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3.
      The SMB protocol uses TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for communication. 
      The default port for SMB is 445.
      If this port open attacker will try to compromise targeted systems using Ransomewhere.
       How SMB Works :
       ---------------
         When a client device wants to access resources (files, printers, etc.) on a server, it initiates an SMB connection. 
         The client sends a request to the server, and a negotiation process occurs to determine the version of SMB to be used.
       Purpose of SMB: : 
       -----------------
         File Sharing, Printer Sharing, Resource Discovery & etc.
       Security Considerations:
       ------------------------
          SMBv1 Vulnerabilities:
          ----------------------
            Older versions of SMB, especially SMBv1, have been associated with security vulnerabilities.
            It is recommended to disable SMBv1 where possible and use more secure versions like SMBv2 or SMBv3.
31) SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) :
---------------------------------------
    It's a signaling protocol used in Voice over IP (VoIP) communication to initiate, maintain, modify, and terminate real-time sessions involving video, voice, messaging, and other communications applications and services. 
    SIP is an application-layer protocol that works in conjunction with other protocols to enable voice and multimedia sessions over IP networks.
    
    SIP Port :
    ----------
     PORT 5060 for non-secure (unencrypted) communication.
     PORT 5061 For secure SIP over TLS (Transport Layer Security). 
     These ports are used for signaling and control messages between SIP devices.
32) MS SQL (Microsoft Structured Query Language) :
--------------------------------------------------
    Purpose: The primary purpose of the MS SQL port is to enable client applications to connect to the SQL Server database.
             It acts as the communication endpoint through which SQL queries, commands, and data are exchanged between the client and the database server.
    Port : 1433
33) NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) :
-------------------------------------------------
    Purpose: Facilitates communication and resource sharing within a local network.
    Ports:
      Port 137: NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS/WINS)
      Port 138: NetBIOS Datagram Service
      Port 139: NetBIOS Session Service
   Usage: Legacy protocol, widely used in earlier versions of Windows.
   Security Best Practices: It is recommended to disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP in environments where it is not needed for compatibility reasons. 
                            Additionally, organizations should implement secure alternatives and consider the use of firewalls and other security measures to control access to NetBIOS-related ports.
NOTE : 
=====
   In networking, there are a total of 0-65,536 ports available for communication. These ports are categorized into three ranges:

  1) Well-Known Ports (0-1023):
  -----------------------------
       The well-known ports are reserved for specific services and protocols that are widely recognized and standardized by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
       Examples include port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, and port 21 for FTP.

  2) Registered Ports (1024-49151):
  ---------------------------------
       Registered ports are used by applications and services that have been registered with IANA but are not as universally recognized as well-known ports. 
       They are typically used for more specific or less common services.

 3) Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535):
 ------------------------------------------
       Dynamic or private ports are often referred to as ephemeral ports. These ports are used by client applications for initiating communication with servers. 
       They are allocated dynamically by the operating system.
