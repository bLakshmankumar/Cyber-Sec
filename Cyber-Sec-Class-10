Network & Cyber Attacks :
========================
 Cyber-Security Main course will start from this class.
 Will discuss about Cyber Attacks and preventuive mechanism.

Before going to attacks we will discuss about two different types of processes.
1) Cyber killChain process   2) Mitree framwork/Mitree att@ck

 > 1) Cyber Kill chain Process : [ Added the image with details to main readme file ]

     It's an offensive mechanism. It's a step by step or phase by phase approach of how attacker will do attack exploitation and also compromise.
     The process typically consists of the following stages :
        Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
        Weaponization: Malicious tools or exploits are created or acquired to be used in the attack. This stage involves combining the chosen exploit with a delivery mechanism.
        Delivery: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target system. This could occur through methods such as email attachments, infected websites, or other means.
        Exploitation: The weaponized payload is executed, exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system. This stage often involves the initial compromise of the system.
        Installation: Malware or other malicious components are installed on the compromised system, allowing the attacker to establish a foothold and maintain access.
        Command and Control (C2): The attacker establishes communication channels to control the compromised system, enabling them to execute further actions, gather information, or escalate the attack.
        Actions on Objectives: The attacker pursues their ultimate goals, which could include data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities.

 > 2) Mitree framwork/Mitree att@ck :
 ------------------------------------
     It's a Offensive + Defensive Mechanism. The MITRE ATT&CK framework (MITRE ATT&CK) is a universally accessible, continuously updated knowledge base for modeling, detecting, preventing and fighting cybersecurity threats based on cybercriminalsâ€™ known adversarial behaviors.
     Att@ck Means :
     --------------
          A - adversary
          T - Tactics
          T - Techniques
          CK - Common Knowledge
