# Cyber-Security Main course will start from this class.
# Will discuss about Cyber Attacks and preventuive mechanism.

Before going to attacks we will discuss about two different types of processes.
1) Cyber killChain process   2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK

 > 1) Cyber Kill chain Process : [ Added the image with details to main readme file ]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # https://github.com/bLakshmankumar/cyber-sec/tree/main

     It's an offensive mechanism. It's a step by step or phase by phase approach of how attacker will do attack exploitation and also compromise.
     The process typically consists of the following stages :
        Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
        Weaponization: Malicious tools or exploits are created or acquired to be used in the attack. This stage involves combining the chosen exploit with a delivery mechanism.
        Delivery: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target system. This could occur through methods such as email attachments, infected websites, or other means.
        Exploitation: The weaponized payload is executed, exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system. This stage often involves the initial compromise of the system.
        Installation: Malware or other malicious components are installed on the compromised system, allowing the attacker to establish a foothold and maintain access.
        Command and Control (C2): The attacker establishes communication channels to control the compromised system, enabling them to execute further actions, gather information, or escalate the attack.
        Actions on Objectives: The attacker pursues their ultimate goals, which could include data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities.

 > 2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK :
 ------------------------------------
     It's a Offensive(Attacker) + Defensive Mechanism(Blue Team or SOC Team). The MITRE ATT&CK framework (MITRE ATT&CK) is a universally accessible, continuously updated knowledge base for modeling, detecting, preventing and fighting cybersecurity threats based on cybercriminals’ known adversarial behaviors.
     It's a Centralized knowledge base, where atatacker will use tactics, techniques and procedures how to compromise the system, along with that mintree framework will provide preventive mechanisms or solutions as well.
     this Framework will be used by Threat hunters, Malware analysts, Reverse Engineering Team, Blue Team, Read Team and Hacker.
     Att@ck Means :
     --------------
          A - adversary
          T - Tactics
          T - Techniques
          CK - Common Knowledge

     Key components of the MITRE ATT&CK framework include:
     -----------------------------------------------------
      Matrix: ATT&CK is presented in matrix form, categorizing adversary behavior into tactics and techniques. Tactics represent high-level objectives, while techniques detail specific methods adversaries use to achieve those objectives.
      Tactics: There are several tactics, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.
      Techniques: Each tactic consists of specific techniques that adversaries may employ. Techniques are more granular descriptions of the methods used in cyber attacks.
      Procedures: MITRE ATT&CK also documents real-world examples of how adversaries have executed specific techniques, known as procedures. This information aids in understanding specific instances of attacks.
      Mitigations: The framework includes recommended mitigations and defensive strategies to help organizations prevent, detect, and respond to attacks effectively.
      The MITRE ATT&CK framework is valuable for organizations in enhancing their cybersecurity defenses by providing a common language for discussing cyber threats and enabling a proactive and informed approach to security.
      It is regularly updated to incorporate new insights into adversary behavior and emerging threats.

     Tactics : [ https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/ ]
     =========
      Initial Access: Adversaries focus on gaining an initial foothold in the target environment, often through methods such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other means.
      Execution: Adversaries attempt to run malicious code on a target system, either to establish a presence or achieve specific objectives.
      Persistence*: Adversaries aim to maintain access to systems over an extended period, often by utilizing techniques such as backdoors or scheduled tasks.
      Privilege Escalation*: Adversaries seek to increase their level of access or control within the target environment, often by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
      Defense Evasion*: Adversaries use various techniques to avoid detection and hinder defensive measures, such as disabling security tools or employing obfuscation.
      Credential Access: Adversaries focus on obtaining account credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or achieve other objectives.
      Discovery: Adversaries aim to gather information about the target environment, including network topology, system configurations, and user accounts, to plan and execute further actions.
      Lateral Movement*: Adversaries move through a network, expanding their presence and accessing additional systems or resources.
      Collection: Adversaries gather data from target systems, often to fulfill their objectives, such as stealing sensitive information.
      Exfiltration*: Adversaries transfer data from the target environment to an external location under their control.
      Impact: Adversaries seek to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy systems and data within the target environment.
      These tactics provide a structured framework for understanding and categorizing the various stages and objectives of a cyber attack.

> Difference Between Cyber Kill Chain process & MITRE ATT&CK framework :
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the Cyber Kill Chain is more focused on the sequential stages of an attack, the MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a broader and more granular view of adversary behavior to inform defensive strategies. 
    Combining both approaches can enhance an organization's overall cybersecurity posture.

# Network & Cyber Attacks : 
  ========================
   Network & Cyber Attacks Types : 
   ===============================
      * Malware
      * Authentication Failure
      * Spoofing
      * Flooding
      * Phishing Email
      * OWASP TOP 10
      * Unknown or Other category attacks.

  > Malware:
  ==========  
    Description: It's a Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems. This includes various types such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.
    Objective: Gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or steal sensitive data.
    Symptoms of Malware : Unusual System Behavior (such as programs crashing, freezing), Missing or Altered Files(Files or directories disappearing, being encrypted, or modified without user action).
    Unrecognized Accounts or Users, High utilization of CPU and RAM.
    Example: A user unknowingly downloads a seemingly innocent file that contains a hidden virus, leading to unauthorized access or data theft.

    > Sources Of Malware : 
    ----------------------
      * Phishing Email Attachments
      * Drive by Downloads (Downloading files from unknown Sources).
      * Removable Devices (Pendrive/Memorystick(Uk people call), External Harddisk.

    > How Malware enter the organization :
    --------------------------------------
     Malware enter through files.

     Different file categories :
     ---------------------------
    .pdf, .exe, .csv, .Rar*(dangeros), .7z*(dangeros), .dll*(dangeros,).xml & more
 
     NOTE : If something is Got compromised but unfortunatily alert is not recieved. it's called True Negative. It's a very importent this scenarios.

     
    > Types of Malwares :
     -------------------
        Worms:
        ------
        Description: Worms are self-replicating malicious programs that spread across networks without requiring user interaction.
                     They can exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications to propagate. It's more dangerous than virus. If one system is compromise, other systems also will also get compromise.
        Example: The "Conficker" worm, which emerged in 2008, infected millions of computers by exploiting Windows vulnerabilities. It spread rapidly through network shares and removable media.
        Symptoms : Unusual network activity or traffic, Increased use of system resources, Degraded network performance.
        Main Attacks : Stuxnet,

        Viruses:
        --------
        Description: Viruses are malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate executable files or documents. They require a host file to spread and execute when the infected file is opened. 
                      Once the file is opened It'll do self replication with in a system(Producing of copies).
        Example: The "Melissa" virus, discovered in 1999, spread through infected Microsoft Word documents sent via email. When opened, it replicated itself and sent copies to the first 50 contacts in the user's address book.
        Symptoms: Unexplained file modifications or deletions, Slower system performance, Unexpected error messages or crashes.

        Trojans:
        --------
        Description: A Trojan, short for Trojan Horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software to deceive users into downloading and installing it.
                     Once inside a system, a Trojan can perform various malicious activities, often without the user's knowledge. 
                     Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves but rely on social engineering to convince users to execute them.
                     They may serve as a backdoor for attackers, facilitating unauthorized access, data theft, or other harmful actions.
        Example: The "Zeus" Trojan, a notorious banking trojan, infiltrated systems by disguising itself as a legitimate program. Once installed, it could steal sensitive banking information and credentials.
        Mitigations: Be Cautious with Downloads: Only download software from trusted sources, Avoid opening unexpected or suspicious email attachments, Use Antivirus Software: Norton, McAfee, Bitdefender. 

        Ransomware:
        -----------
        Description: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files or entire system, rendering it inaccessible. 
                     The attacker then demands a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.
        Example: The "WannaCry" ransomware, which emerged in 2017, exploited a Windows vulnerability to rapidly infect systems worldwide. It encrypted files and demanded ransom payments for decryption keys.
        Top Attacks : Wanna Cry, Petya(It's propagation(Comes) through Network and "Ps.exe", Pegacus, kaseya.
        Port num for this attack : 445 (Server Message Block).
        Mitigations : Regular Backups, Endpoint Protection, Patch Management, Least Privilege Principle (Assign the least privilege necessary for users and systems to perform their tasks), Network Segmentation.

        BackDoor :
        ----------
        Description: Creates a hidden access point in a system, allowing unauthorized entry. Bypassing the main authentication.
        Example: The "NetCAT" backdoor exploited vulnerabilities in Intel server-grade processors to enable unauthorized network eavesdropping.
        Mitigation Tools : MFA, NGFW, AM(anti malware).
       
        Botnet:
        -------
        Description: Network of compromised computers controlled by a central entity for malicious purposes.
        Example: The "Mirai" botnet in 2016 infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, launching massive DDoS attacks against websites.

       Spyware:
       --------
       Description: Spyware is malicious software designed to secretly observe and collect information about a user's online activities without their knowledge or consent.
                    This can include keystrokes, browsing habits, login credentials, and sensitive personal information. 
                    Spyware often comes bundled with seemingly legitimate software or is downloaded unknowingly by the user.
       Example: "FinSpy" spyware targeted individuals and organizations, collecting sensitive data and facilitating espionage.
       Mitigations: Implement Network Security(Employ network security measures, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), to detect and prevent spyware-related activities).
      
       Logic Bomb:
       -----------
       Description: Code triggered by specific conditions, leading to malicious actions.
       Example: An insider at a financial institution inserts a logic bomb that activates if they are terminated, deleting critical data.

       Rootkit: [Root=Highest level access in unix/linux] [Kit=tool]
       --------
       Description: A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized Root level access to a computer system or network.
                    Once it's installed, a rootkit aims to conceal its presence and activities, allowing attackers to maintain privileged access and control over the compromised system.
       Example: Once attacker will get the Root level access later he will change the Passwords, Add/Delete/Modify the files, Changing the keys & more. 
       Mitigations : MFA, RBAC, MBR(Master Booter Record Scanning).[Whenever we install the EDR agent It'll scan Master Booter Record also].

       Adware:
       -------
       Description: Attacker will use these malicious adware acripts or files in the websites. Whenver user clicking on those scripts it will install and execute and finally system will get compromise.
                   It Displays unwanted advertisements or redirects users to advertising sites then Adware will occur based on the user actions.
       Example: pop up's , "CrossRider" adware delivered intrusive pop-up ads and collected user data from infected systems.
       Mitigations : AV/EDR, NGFW, PROXY, AM & etc.

       Key Loggers or Key Strokers or key logging :
       --------------------------------------------
       Description: Attacker will inject key logger malware into the targeted system and then he will capture whatever keys are typing by end user.
       Example : PII(Personal Identifiable Information) data like Credentials, Bank Information, Credit/Debit card details & etc.
       Mitigations : AV, AM, NGFW, Malware analysis Tools.

       Privilege Escalation :
       ----------------------
       Description : Privilege escalation is a cyberattack technique where an attacker gains unauthorized access to higher privileges by leveraging security flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities in an organization’s system.
       Mitigations : Use Strong Authentication(MFA), User Permissions(Assign the minimum level of access or permissions necessary for users).
 
   All these above types of attacks will comes to SIEM tool and Once attack comes to SIEM tool as a Security analyst we have to identify weather it's a really happened or not.
 
Mitigation for Malware attacks :
--------------------------------
     * AntiVirus(AV)/EDR
     * AM (Anti Malware)
     * NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)
     * Email Security Gateways for Proofpoint, Mimecast, Barracuda.
     * Behavioral Analysis Tools (Example: Darktrace, Vectra AI, Cynet.)
     * Malware analysis Tools (F5, Fire eye, Cisco Source fire)

NOTE : If we compromise our system from malware attack, if you have any doubt, If it's a windows laptop You can go to Task manager and verify which file has accupied by more memory and other things.
