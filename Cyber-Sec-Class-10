# Cyber-Security Main course will start from this class.
# Will discuss about Cyber Attacks and preventuive mechanism.
# Classes from [Class 16 - Class 20].

Before going to attacks we will discuss about two different types of processes.
1) Cyber killChain process   2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK

 > 1) Cyber Kill chain Process : [ Added the image with details to main readme file ]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # https://github.com/bLakshmankumar/cyber-sec/tree/main

     It's an offensive mechanism. It's a step by step or phase by phase approach of how attacker will do attack exploitation and also compromise.
     The process typically consists of the following stages :
        Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
        Weaponization: Malicious tools or exploits are created or acquired to be used in the attack. This stage involves combining the chosen exploit with a delivery mechanism.
        Delivery: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target system. This could occur through methods such as email attachments, infected websites, or other means.
        Exploitation: The weaponized payload is executed, exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system. This stage often involves the initial compromise of the system.
        Installation: Malware or other malicious components are installed on the compromised system, allowing the attacker to establish a foothold and maintain access.
        Command and Control (C2): The attacker establishes communication channels to control the compromised system, enabling them to execute further actions, gather information, or escalate the attack.
        Actions on Objectives: The attacker pursues their ultimate goals, which could include data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities.

 > 2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK :
 ------------------------------------
     It's a Offensive(Attacker) + Defensive Mechanism(Blue Team or SOC Team). The MITRE ATT&CK framework (MITRE ATT&CK) is a universally accessible, continuously updated knowledge base for modeling, detecting, preventing and fighting cybersecurity threats based on cybercriminals’ known adversarial behaviors.
     It's a Centralized knowledge base, where atatacker will use tactics, techniques and procedures how to compromise the system, along with that mintree framework will provide preventive mechanisms or solutions as well.
     this Framework will be used by Threat hunters, Malware analysts, Reverse Engineering Team, Blue Team, Read Team and Hacker.
     Att@ck Means :
     --------------
          A - adversary
          T - Tactics
          T - Techniques
          CK - Common Knowledge

     Key components of the MITRE ATT&CK framework include:
     -----------------------------------------------------
      Matrix: ATT&CK is presented in matrix form, categorizing adversary behavior into tactics and techniques. Tactics represent high-level objectives, while techniques detail specific methods adversaries use to achieve those objectives.
      Tactics: There are several tactics, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.
      Techniques: Each tactic consists of specific techniques that adversaries may employ. Techniques are more granular descriptions of the methods used in cyber attacks.
      Procedures: MITRE ATT&CK also documents real-world examples of how adversaries have executed specific techniques, known as procedures. This information aids in understanding specific instances of attacks.
      Mitigations: The framework includes recommended mitigations and defensive strategies to help organizations prevent, detect, and respond to attacks effectively.
      The MITRE ATT&CK framework is valuable for organizations in enhancing their cybersecurity defenses by providing a common language for discussing cyber threats and enabling a proactive and informed approach to security.
      It is regularly updated to incorporate new insights into adversary behavior and emerging threats.

     Tactics : [ https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/ ]
     =========
      Initial Access: Adversaries focus on gaining an initial foothold in the target environment, often through methods such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other means.
      Execution: Adversaries attempt to run malicious code on a target system, either to establish a presence or achieve specific objectives.
      Persistence*: Adversaries aim to maintain access to systems over an extended period, often by utilizing techniques such as backdoors or scheduled tasks.
      Privilege Escalation*: Adversaries seek to increase their level of access or control within the target environment, often by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
      Defense Evasion*: Adversaries use various techniques to avoid detection and hinder defensive measures, such as disabling security tools or employing obfuscation.
      Credential Access: Adversaries focus on obtaining account credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or achieve other objectives.
      Discovery: Adversaries aim to gather information about the target environment, including network topology, system configurations, and user accounts, to plan and execute further actions.
      Lateral Movement*: Adversaries move through a network, expanding their presence and accessing additional systems or resources.
      Collection: Adversaries gather data from target systems, often to fulfill their objectives, such as stealing sensitive information.
      Exfiltration*: Adversaries transfer data from the target environment to an external location under their control.
      Impact: Adversaries seek to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy systems and data within the target environment.
      These tactics provide a structured framework for understanding and categorizing the various stages and objectives of a cyber attack.

> Difference Between Cyber Kill Chain process & MITRE ATT&CK framework :
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the Cyber Kill Chain is more focused on the sequential stages of an attack, the MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a broader and more granular view of adversary behavior to inform defensive strategies. 
    Combining both approaches can enhance an organization's overall cybersecurity posture.

      * Flooding
      * Phishing Email
      * OWASP TOP 10
      * Unknown or Other category attacks.

 1 > Malware Category Attacks:
  ============================  
    Description: It's a Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems. This includes various types such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.
    Objective: Gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or steal sensitive data.
    Symptoms of Malware : Unusual System Behavior (such as programs crashing, freezing), Missing or Altered Files(Files or directories disappearing, being encrypted, or modified without user action).
    Unrecognized Accounts or Users, High utilization of CPU and RAM.
    Example: A user unknowingly downloads a seemingly innocent file that contains a hidden virus, leading to unauthorized access or data theft.

    > Sources Of Malware : 
    ----------------------
      * Phishing Email Attachments
      * Drive by Downloads (Downloading files from unknown Sources).
      * Removable Devices (Pendrive/Memorystick(Uk people call), External Harddisk.

    > How Malware enter the organization :
    --------------------------------------
     Malware enter through files.

     Different file categories :
     ---------------------------
    .pdf, .exe, .csv, .Rar*(dangeros), .7z*(dangeros), .dll*(dangeros,).xml & more
 
     NOTE : If something is Got compromised but unfortunatily alert is not recieved. it's called True Negative. It's a very importent this scenarios.

     
    > Types of Malware Attacks :
     ---------------------------
        Worms:
        ------
        Description: Worms are self-replicating malicious programs that spread across networks without requiring user interaction.
                     They can exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications to propagate. It's more dangerous than virus. If one system is compromise, other systems also will also get compromise.
        Example: The "Conficker" worm, which emerged in 2008, infected millions of computers by exploiting Windows vulnerabilities. It spread rapidly through network shares and removable media.
        Symptoms : Unusual network activity or traffic, Increased use of system resources, Degraded network performance.
        Main Attacks : Stuxnet,

        Viruses:
        --------
        Description: Viruses are malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate executable files or documents. They require a host file to spread and execute when the infected file is opened. 
                      Once the file is opened It'll do self replication with in a system(Producing of copies).
        Example: The "Melissa" virus, discovered in 1999, spread through infected Microsoft Word documents sent via email. When opened, it replicated itself and sent copies to the first 50 contacts in the user's address book.
        Symptoms: Unexplained file modifications or deletions, Slower system performance, Unexpected error messages or crashes.

        Trojans:
        --------
        Description: A Trojan, short for Trojan Horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software to deceive users into downloading and installing it.
                     Once inside a system, a Trojan can perform various malicious activities, often without the user's knowledge. 
                     Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves but rely on social engineering to convince users to execute them.
                     They may serve as a backdoor for attackers, facilitating unauthorized access, data theft, or other harmful actions.
        Example: The "Zeus" Trojan, a notorious banking trojan, infiltrated systems by disguising itself as a legitimate program. Once installed, it could steal sensitive banking information and credentials.
        Mitigations: Be Cautious with Downloads: Only download software from trusted sources, Avoid opening unexpected or suspicious email attachments, Use Antivirus Software: Norton, McAfee, Bitdefender. 

        Ransomware:
        -----------
        Description: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files or entire system, rendering it inaccessible. 
                     The attacker then demands a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.
        Example: The "WannaCry" ransomware, which emerged in 2017, exploited a Windows vulnerability to rapidly infect systems worldwide. It encrypted files and demanded ransom payments for decryption keys.
        Top Attacks : Wanna Cry, Petya(It's propagation(Comes) through Network and "Ps.exe", Pegacus, kaseya.
        Port num for this attack : 445 (Server Message Block).

        BackDoor :
        ----------
        Description: Creates a hidden access point in a system, allowing unauthorized entry. Bypassing the main authentication.
        Example: The "NetCAT" backdoor exploited vulnerabilities in Intel server-grade processors to enable unauthorized network eavesdropping.
        Mitigation Tools : MFA, NGFW, AM(anti malware).

       Spyware:
       --------
       Description: Spyware is malicious software designed to secretly observe and collect information about a user's online activities without their knowledge or consent.
                    This can include keystrokes, browsing habits, login credentials, and sensitive personal information. 
                    Spyware often comes bundled with seemingly legitimate software or is downloaded unknowingly by the user.
       Example: "FinSpy" spyware targeted individuals and organizations, collecting sensitive data and facilitating espionage.
       Mitigations: Implement Network Security(Employ network security measures, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), to detect and prevent spyware-related activities).
      
       Logic Bomb:
       -----------
       Description: Code triggered by specific conditions, leading to malicious actions.
       Example: An insider at a financial institution inserts a logic bomb that activates if they are terminated, deleting critical data.

       Rootkit: [Root=Highest level access in unix/linux] [Kit=tool]
       --------
       Description: A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized Root level access to a computer system or network.
                    Once it's installed, a rootkit aims to conceal its presence and activities, allowing attackers to maintain privileged access and control over the compromised system.
       Example: Once attacker will get the Root level access later he will change the Passwords, Add/Delete/Modify the files, Changing the keys & more. 
       Mitigations : MFA, RBAC, MBR(Master Booter Record Scanning).[Whenever we install the EDR agent It'll scan Master Booter Record also], TCP dump analysis, Memory dump analysis.

       Adware:
       -------
       Description: Attacker will use these malicious adware acripts or files in the websites. Whenver user clicking on those scripts it will install and execute and finally system will get compromise.
                   It Displays unwanted advertisements or redirects users to advertising sites then Adware will occur based on the user actions.
       Example: pop up's , "CrossRider" adware delivered intrusive pop-up ads and collected user data from infected systems.
       Mitigations : AV/EDR, NGFW, PROXY, AM & etc.

       Zero Day Attack :
       -----------------
       Description: Zero-day vulnerabilities are called "zero-day" because they are exploited on the same day that the vulnerability is discovered by attackers, giving developers zero days to address and patch the issue.
                    Since there is no available fix or patch, zero-day attacks pose significant risks to organizations and individuals.
       Temorary Fix : Identify the business domains or business IP'S and only Whitelist the business domains or business IP'S, except these put everythiing on Blacklist.
       Mitigations: Patch Management(Implement a robust patch management process to ensure that software, operating systems, and firmware are regularly updated with the latest security patches)
                    Zero-Day Threat Intelligence (Subscribe to threat intelligence feeds and services to stay informed about emerging zero-day vulnerabilities and attacks, enabling proactive defense measures).
                       Cisco Talos Intelligence : Cisco Talos Intelligence offers threat intelligence feeds and services that deliver actionable insights into threats, including zero-day vulnerabilities, malware, and botnets.
                       IBM X-Force Exchange: It provides threat intelligence sharing, including data on vulnerabilities, malware, and security incidents. It offers both free and premium services. 
                       Vulnerability Management : Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited in zero-day attacks.

       RAT Attack (Remote Access Trojan):
       ----------------------------------
       Description: A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides remote access and control over a victim's computer without their knowledge or consent. 
                    RATs are typically delivered through malicious email attachments, software downloads, or compromised websites.
                    Once installed, the attacker gains full control of the infected system, allowing them to perform various malicious activities, such as spying on user activities, stealing sensitive information, or deploying additional malware.
       Mitigations: AV/AM, Regular Software Updates.

       BotNet Attack :
       ---------------
       Description: A botnet attack occurs when a network of compromised computers, known as bots or zombies, is remotely controlled by an attacker, typically through a command and control (C&C) infrastructure.
                    Attacker will send either malware attachments, or else phishing emails or else malicious urls to send the malware to the targeted system.
                    Then whoever the user using those systems got compromised and attacker will control the systems remotely.
       Bot Header : Who ever controlling the compromised system(bot or Zombie) called as bot header.
       Bot/Zombie : Whaterver the System is compromised we can call that system as Bot/Zombie.
       Mitigations : Anomaly Detection, AV & AM, Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)[Using IDS/IPS solutions to detect and block botnet-related activities, such as command and control communications and brute-force attacks].

       Logic Bomb Attack:
       ------------------
       Description : A logic bomb is a type of malicious code or software that is intentionally inserted into a system or program to execute a harmful action when specific conditions are met.
                     Unlike other types of malware that may immediately cause damage upon execution, logic bombs remain dormant until triggered by a predefined event, such as a certain date or time, a specific user action, or the occurrence of particular conditions within the system.
       Mitigations : Code Review and Testing, Backup and Recovery, Access Control and Least Privilege.

       Data Exfiltration Attack:
       -------------------------
       Description : A data exfiltration attack, also known as data exfiltration or data theft, is a cyberattack where unauthorized parties steal sensitive or confidential data from a target system or network. 
                     Attackers gain access to the data and transfer it outside the organization's network, often to their own servers or storage locations. 
                     The stolen data can include personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, financial records, or other valuable assets.
       Mitigations : Data Encryption, Endpoint Security[EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), and EPP (Endpoint Protection Platforms)].

       Key Loggers or Key Strokers or key logging :
       --------------------------------------------
       Description: Attacker will inject key logger malware into the targeted system and then he will capture whatever keys are typing by end user.
       Example : PII(Personal Identifiable Information) data like Credentials, Bank Information, Credit/Debit card details & etc.
       Mitigations : AV, AM, NGFW, Malware analysis Tools.

       Privilege Escalation :
       ----------------------
       Description : Privilege escalation is a cyberattack technique where an attacker gains unauthorized access to higher privileges by leveraging security flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities in an organization’s system.
       Mitigations : Use Strong Authentication(MFA), User Permissions(Assign the minimum level of access or permissions necessary for users).
 
   All these above types of attacks will comes to SIEM tool and Once attack comes to SIEM tool as a Security analyst we have to identify weather it's a really happened or not.

   Mitigation for Malware attacks :
   --------------------------------
     * AntiVirus(AV)/EDR
     * AM (Anti Malware)
     * NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)

2 > Unkonwn or wellknown category attacks : 
===========================================
       Social Engineering(public) Attack :
       -----------------------------------
        Description : Sharing the Confidential Data in the pulic is called as social engineering attack.
        Mitigations : MFA, Behavioral Sense.

       Shoulder Surfing Attack : 
       -------------------------
        Descrption : Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering attack where an unauthorized individual observes or captures sensitive information, such as passwords, PINs, or access codes, by watching over the victim's shoulder as they enter or access this information.
                     This type of attack can occur in various settings, including ATMs, public spaces, and work environments, where individuals might inadvertently expose confidential information.
        Mitigations : Behavioral Sense(Common sense).

       Eavesdropping Attack: 
       ---------------------
        Description : Secretly listening other people conversation is called as Eavesdropping.
        Mitigations : Behavioral Sense(Common sense), Security awareness.
      
       Lateral Movement Attack:
       ------------------------
       Description : Attacker will first compromise one end system, Then from that system he will compromise other systems is called as lateral Movement attack.
       Techniques : https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/
       Mitigations : Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).

       Persistence Attack : 
       --------------------
        Description : Even through defensive team is clearing the infection still some of the infection will be existing.
                      A persistence attack refers to the techniques used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period. 
                      After gaining initial access, attackers aim to ensure continued control and access, even after system reboots or security measures are implemented. 
                      Persistence mechanisms allow attackers to maintain a foothold on the compromised system, enabling them to carry out malicious activities, exfiltrate data, or launch further attacks.
        Issues : Device Access restarts, Changed Credentials, Other interption even after clearing the infection.
        Techniques : https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/
        Mitigations : Regular Security Audits, NIPS/NIDS, 


3 > Phishing Email Attacks Category : Ref to learn more : [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-identify-them/]
=====================================
     Description : A phishing email is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker sends a fraudulent email disguised as a legitimate communication from a reputable source, such as a trusted organization or individual. 
                   The goal of a phishing email is to deceive recipients into taking specific actions, such as clicking on malicious links, downloading malicious attachments, or providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.
     Mitigations : Check the Sender's Email Address, Look for Spelling and Grammar Errors, Verify Requests for Sensitive Information, Avoid Unsolicited Attachments.
     Examples identifications : Fake Invoices requests, gifts, Password change, pdf attachments & Malicious url's& etc.

     How does phishing work : 
     ------------------------
     Phishing starts with a fraudulent email or other communication that is designed to lure a victim. The message is made to look as though it comes from a trusted sender. 
     If it fools the victim, he or she is coaxed into providing confidential information, often on a scam website. Sometimes malware is also downloaded onto the target’s computer.
    
     Types of Phishing Email Attacks : Ref-link to learn more [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-identify-them/ ]
     ---------------------------------
         Spear phishing attack :
         -----------------------
         Description : Spear phishing targets specific individuals instead of a wide group of people. An example of this would be a phishing email targeting an employee of a company by pretending to be their boss.
                       In the email, the scammer may try to get the employee to give up private information that the scammer can later  use to their advantage. 
         Prevention tip: Always double-check the sender's email address before responding.
         Prevention Tools : Email Gateway solutions(Proof pointer*, Iron Port, O365outlook-defender), AV/EDR, Security Awareness.
   
         HTTPS phishing attack :
         ----------------------
          Description : HTTPS phishing is when a cybercriminal tricks you into giving up your personal information using a malicious  website. 
                        To get you onto these sites, the phisher will hide the malicious link within an email, often masquerading  as a link to a legitimate site.
          Example : For example, an HTTPS phishing scam could be an email asking you to log into Instagram to secure your account. In the email, it would look like you’re talking to an Instagram support member when in fact it is all a hoax. 
                    When  you click the link, you’ll instead be taken to a fake website designed to steal your login credentials. 
          Prevention tip: Always look closely at the URL of a site before logging in.

         Whaling Attack :
         ----------------
         Description : When attackers go after a “big fish” like a CEO, it’s called whaling. 
                       These attackers often spend considerable time profiling the target to find the opportune moment and means of stealing login credentials. 
         Example : A high-level executive at your company might reach out about a financial crisis that they need your help with.
                   To solve this problem, the phisher may ask for login information or a wire transfer of funds.
         Prevention tip: If you receive a suspicious email from a coworker, reach out to them directly to confirm its legitimacy, Security Awarness.

         Vishing :
         ---------
         Description : Vishing is short for “voice phishing”, which consists of tricking people on the phone, persuading them to divulge sensitive information.
                       In this type of attack, the attacker tries to steal the victim’s data and use it to his advantage. 
         Example : For example this would be a random call from your credit card company claiming your account has been compromised.
                   To secure your account, the scammer will ask you for your personal information, if Victim provide the personal information (credit/debit card details/username/password),
                   He will compromise the money or etc.
         Prevention tip: If you ever receive a suspicious call, hang up before giving away any information. It's completely behavioural sense.
        
         Smishing :
         ----------
         Description : Smishing is sending a message that requires someone to take action. This is the next evolution of vishing.
                        Often the text includes a link that, when clicked, installs malware on the user’s device.
         Example :  Victim will receive a text message from a random number informing you that you’ve won a contest or gift card. 
                    In these smishing scams, a cybercriminal will send you a link you can click to “claim your prize.” While a free gift may sound enticing, this is only an attempt to get you onto their fraudulent site.     
         Prevention tip: Avoid opening links from unknown phone numbers.

  Steps for investigating a possible email phishing incident :
  --------------------------------------------------------------
     Analyze the contents of the headers
     Analyze the URL/file collected.
     Domain Validation.
     IP validation
     Determine the impact.
        Who else got this email?
        Was it spear phishing or a phishing campaign?
        Did the victim click the URLs in the body of the email?
        Did they open the attached files? If yes, is any account and/or critical asset compromised?

4 > Flooding Category Attacks : [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-flood-attack/]
===============================
    Description : Attacker will send a millions of requests to targeted system/server/application at a specific time. Finally System/server/appllication is not able to handle those requests, 
                  Then sysstem/server will crashed and application will be unavailable.
    
    > Types of Flooding Attacks :
    -----------------------------
       UDP Flood Attack :
       -----------------
         In a UDP flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to a target server, consuming its bandwidth and resources.
         Since UDP is connectionless and does not require a handshake, attackers can easily spoof the source IP addresses, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.
       
       TCP SYN Flood Attack :
       ----------------------
         A TCP SYN flood attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake process by sending a large number of SYN (synchronize) packets to a target server, but not completing the handshake by sending the final ACK (acknowledge) packet.
         This results in the target server maintaining half-open connections and consuming resources, eventually leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
         Mitigation : Implement anti DOS or Anti DDOS tools in parallal ISP Router., Implemet NIDS/NIPS solutions, Impliment Rate limit or Throttling in Filrewall or WAF.

       ICMP Flood (Ping Flood) Attack :
       --------------------------------
         In an ICMP flood or ping flood attack, the attacker sends a high volume of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets (ping requests) to a target server.
         The server replies to each ping request, consuming its network bandwidth and processing power, ultimately leading to a denial of service.
      
       HTTP Flood Attack :
       --------------------
         An HTTP flood attack targets web servers by sending a large number of HTTP GET or POST requests to overwhelm the server's capacity to handle incoming connections and process requests. 
         This can result in degraded performance or complete unavailability of the web server for legitimate users.

       DNS Flood Attack:
       -----------------
         A DNS flood attack targets Domain Name System (DNS) servers by sending a high volume of DNS query requests, exhausting the server's resources and causing it to become unresponsive. 
         This can disrupt access to legitimate websites and services that rely on DNS resolution.
      
       DOS Flooding Attack : [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dos-and-ddos-attack/]
       --------------------
         It's is a denial of service attack, in this attack a computer sends a massive amount of traffic to a victim’s computer and shuts it down. 
         Dos attack is an online attack that is used to make the website unavailable for its users when done on a website. 
         This attack makes the server of a website that is connected to the internet by sending a large number of traffic to it. 

       DDOS Flood Attack :
       -------------------
         It means distributed denial of service, In this attack dos attacks are done from many different locations using many systems.

       MAC flooding Attack : (media access control attack)
       ---------------------------------------------------
         MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. Attacker will send a millions of dummy ethernet frames(requests) to switch,
         And Switch can't handle those many requests, Then finally switch will becomde crashed or damages or outage or unavailable.
      
       Ping/ICMP Flood Attack : [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ping-flood-attack/]
       -----------------------
         Ping flood attack also commonly called ICMP attack (Internet Control Message Protocol Attack) is a form of DOS attack. In a Ping flood attack, the computing device is flooded with tons of Internet Control Message Protocol ping requests. 
         ICMP requests are used to check for the health status of networking devices and the connectivity between devices. 
         Here, the tons of requests, which flood the computing device, make the target unreachable. Ping flood requests flood the target continuously, leaving no time for the target to respond back to the requests. 

       Ping of Death Attack : 
       ----------------------
         Attacker will send over sized packets of the bits to the system, Then the system is not able to handle that much packet size.
         Ex: ping 8.8.8.8=32 bit, but attacker will send a more than 32 bits size packets so the system can't handle thsoe packet size and system will compromise.
         The ping of death is a part of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that occurs when an attacker crashes, destabilizes, or freezes computers or services by targeting them with oversized data packets.
       
       Dos attack :
       ------------
         A denial-of-service (DoS) attack floods a server with traffic, making a website or resource unavailable. 
         Single attacker will sends a large number of floodings of the requests to the targeted system/server/application, Then server will not available due to over flooding requests, 
         Because of the illigitimate or unathorized attacker.

       DDoS attack :
       -------------
         A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a DoS attack that uses multiple computers or machines to flood a targeted resource.
         Both types of attacks overload a server or web application with the goal of interrupting services. 
      
       Note : "All flooding of the attacks will fall under application availability as per CIA Traid".

Prevention Tips for flooding Attacks :
--------------------------------------
    WAF(WEB Access Firewalls).
    Deploy Anti DOS/DDOS tools : [Tools Like Akkamai, Baracuda, Imperva, F5, Azure DDOS, AWS Shield]. These services often use a combination of traffic filtering, and other tactics to ensure only legitimate traffic reaches the target. 
    Set up secondary DNS : If the primary DNS server becomes overwhelmed due to a flood attack, the secondary DNS server can continue to resolve domain names, ensuring that services remain accessible to legitimate users.
    TTL Analysis: Investigate the TTL values on incoming packets. Abnormal TTLs can indicate potential malicious traffic.
    Install and use antivirus software.
    Update your operating system on a regular basis.
    Install patches, updates, and other patches as soon as they are released by the manufacturer.
    Limit the number of ICMP messages and ping requests (for Ping/ICMP Flood Attack).

5 > Authentication Failure Category Attacks :
=============================================
      Authentication failure attacks that are exploit weaknesses in authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data.
      These attacks target authentication processes, such as password authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or authentication tokens, to bypass security controls and gain illegitimate access. 
      Authentication failure attacks can lead to data breaches, account takeovers, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      
      > Types of Flooding Attacks :
      -----------------------------
          * Dictionary Attack

       * Dictionary Attack :
       ---------------------
           Description: In a dictionary attack, attackers use a predefined list of commonly used passwords or dictionary words to guess user credentials and gain unauthorized access.
           Mitigations: Set up a Complex passwd(Combine letters, numbers, and symbols), implement account lockout policies(password Trying attempts), MFA, and Password Rotation.
       
       *Brute Force Attack : [ https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/brute-force-attack ]
       ----------------------
           Description: A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. 
                        Here, the attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, until the correct password is found.
           Mitigations: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), Limit login attempts, Use unique passwords for every account, Change your password periodically.

       * Password Spray Attack :
       -------------------------
           Description: Password spraying is a type of brute force attack which involves a malicious actor attempting to use the same password on multiple accounts before moving on to try another one.
                        Password spraying attacks are often effective because many users use simple and easy-to-guess passwords, such as “password” or “123456” and so on. 
           Mitigations: Strong Password Policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Training and Awareness, Account Lockout Policies.

       *Rainbow Table Attack: To Learn more about this attack [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-rainbow-table-attack/]
       ----------------------
           Description: Rainbow table attacks involve precomputing hashes for a large number of possible passwords and using them to quickly crack hashed passwords obtained from compromised systems.
           Mitigations: Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), implement salting and key stretching techniques, and regularly update password hashes to protect against rainbow table attacks.

        What is IP Packet :
        -------------------
          An IP (Internet Protocol) packet is a fundamental unit of data transmission in computer networks, used to carry data from a source to a destination over an IP-based network, such as the internet or a local area network (LAN).
         
        Key Components of an IP Packet: 
        -------------------------------
          IP pakcet conatins two Components :
          ------------------------------------
              1) Header    2) Payload
          1) Header: The IP packet header contains control information necessary for routing and delivering the packet to its destination. Key fields in the IP header include:
               Version: Indicates the version of the IP protocol being used (IPv4 or IPv6).
               Header Length: Specifies the length of the IP header in 32-bit words.
               Type of Service (TOS): Specifies the quality of service (QoS) requirements for the packet.
               Total Length: Indicates the total length of the IP packet, including the header and payload data.
               Identification, Flags, and Fragment Offset: Used for fragmentation and reassembly of IP packets if they exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a network link.
               Time-to-Live (TTL): Specifies the maximum number of router hops the packet can traverse before being discarded to prevent infinite loops.
               Protocol: Specifies the higher-layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) used by the payload data.
               Header Checksum: Provides error detection for the IP header.
               Source IP Address: Identifies the sender of the packet.
               Destination IP Address: Specifies the intended recipient of the packet.
          2) Payload: The payload of the IP packet contains the actual data being transmitted, such as segments of a TCP or UDP stream, ICMP messages, or application-layer data. 
                      The payload size can vary depending on the type of data being transmitted and the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network.

      *IP Spoofing Attack:
      ---------------------
         Description: Attacker will mask his original IP address using Spoofing and the he will send the request on behalf of the end/actual user. Then he will gain unauthorized access or sensitive data exposer.
         Mitigation : Stateful inspection firewall, Deep packet inspection.
     
      *Email Spoofing Attack:
      ------------------------
         Description: Email spoofing attacks involve forging the sender's email address to impersonate a legitimate sender, tricking recipients into believing that the email is from a trusted source,
                      and luring them into clicking on malicious links, divulging sensitive information, or downloading malware.
         Prevention Tips: Implement email authentication protocols such as Proof point, Iron Port-Cisco, Also in SMTP server we have to configure : SPF, DKIM, and DMARC tools to detect and prevent email spoofing, 
                          Use email filtering and anti-phishing solutions to detect and block spoofed emails, and educate users about recognizing phishing attempts.
     
      *ARP Spoofing (ARP Cache Poisoning): ARP Protocal it will convert/Map Layer3 IP Address to Layer2 Physical address that's called MAC address. It'll fall under network layer.
      ------------------------------------
         Description: ARP spoofing attacks manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device, 
                      intercepting and redirecting network traffic or launching man-in-the-middle attacks.
                      ARP spoofing is a hacking method that causes network traffic to be redirected to a hacker. Sniffing out LAN addresses on both wired and wireless LAN networks is known as spoofing.
                      The idea behind this sort of spoofing is to transmit false ARP communications to Ethernet LANs, which can cause traffic to be modified or blocked entirely.
         Prevention Tips: Encryption, Packet filters, Deploy ARP spoofing detection tools or intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), 
                          Use static ARP entries or dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) to prevent ARP cache poisoning, and implement network segmentation to limit the impact of ARP spoofing attacks.
