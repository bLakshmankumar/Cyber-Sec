Network & Cyber Attacks : 
========================
 Cyber-Security Main course will start from this class.
 Will discuss about Cyber Attacks and preventuive mechanism.

Before going to attacks we will discuss about two different types of processes.
1) Cyber killChain process   2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK

 > 1) Cyber Kill chain Process : [ Added the image with details to main readme file ]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # https://github.com/bLakshmankumar/cyber-sec/tree/main

     It's an offensive mechanism. It's a step by step or phase by phase approach of how attacker will do attack exploitation and also compromise.
     The process typically consists of the following stages :
        Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
        Weaponization: Malicious tools or exploits are created or acquired to be used in the attack. This stage involves combining the chosen exploit with a delivery mechanism.
        Delivery: The attacker delivers the weaponized payload to the target system. This could occur through methods such as email attachments, infected websites, or other means.
        Exploitation: The weaponized payload is executed, exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system. This stage often involves the initial compromise of the system.
        Installation: Malware or other malicious components are installed on the compromised system, allowing the attacker to establish a foothold and maintain access.
        Command and Control (C2): The attacker establishes communication channels to control the compromised system, enabling them to execute further actions, gather information, or escalate the attack.
        Actions on Objectives: The attacker pursues their ultimate goals, which could include data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities.

 > 2) Mitree framwork/MITRE ATT&CK :
 ------------------------------------
     It's a Offensive(Attacker) + Defensive Mechanism(Blue Team or SOC Team). The MITRE ATT&CK framework (MITRE ATT&CK) is a universally accessible, continuously updated knowledge base for modeling, detecting, preventing and fighting cybersecurity threats based on cybercriminalsâ€™ known adversarial behaviors.
     It's a Centralized knowledge base, where atatacker will use tactics, techniques and procedures how to compromise the system, along with that mintree framework will provide preventive mechanisms or solutions as well.
     this Framework will be used by Threat hunters, Malware analysts, Reverse Engineering Team, Blue Team, Read Team and Hacker.
     Att@ck Means :
     --------------
          A - adversary
          T - Tactics
          T - Techniques
          CK - Common Knowledge

     Key components of the MITRE ATT&CK framework include:
     -----------------------------------------------------
      Matrix: ATT&CK is presented in matrix form, categorizing adversary behavior into tactics and techniques. Tactics represent high-level objectives, while techniques detail specific methods adversaries use to achieve those objectives.
      Tactics: There are several tactics, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.
      Techniques: Each tactic consists of specific techniques that adversaries may employ. Techniques are more granular descriptions of the methods used in cyber attacks.
      Procedures: MITRE ATT&CK also documents real-world examples of how adversaries have executed specific techniques, known as procedures. This information aids in understanding specific instances of attacks.
      Mitigations: The framework includes recommended mitigations and defensive strategies to help organizations prevent, detect, and respond to attacks effectively.
      The MITRE ATT&CK framework is valuable for organizations in enhancing their cybersecurity defenses by providing a common language for discussing cyber threats and enabling a proactive and informed approach to security.
      It is regularly updated to incorporate new insights into adversary behavior and emerging threats.

     Tactics : [ https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/ ]
     =========
      Initial Access: Adversaries focus on gaining an initial foothold in the target environment, often through methods such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other means.
      Execution: Adversaries attempt to run malicious code on a target system, either to establish a presence or achieve specific objectives.
      Persistence*: Adversaries aim to maintain access to systems over an extended period, often by utilizing techniques such as backdoors or scheduled tasks.
      Privilege Escalation*: Adversaries seek to increase their level of access or control within the target environment, often by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
      Defense Evasion*: Adversaries use various techniques to avoid detection and hinder defensive measures, such as disabling security tools or employing obfuscation.
      Credential Access: Adversaries focus on obtaining account credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, or achieve other objectives.
      Discovery: Adversaries aim to gather information about the target environment, including network topology, system configurations, and user accounts, to plan and execute further actions.
      Lateral Movement*: Adversaries move through a network, expanding their presence and accessing additional systems or resources.
      Collection: Adversaries gather data from target systems, often to fulfill their objectives, such as stealing sensitive information.
      Exfiltration*: Adversaries transfer data from the target environment to an external location under their control.
      Impact: Adversaries seek to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy systems and data within the target environment.
      These tactics provide a structured framework for understanding and categorizing the various stages and objectives of a cyber attack.

> Difference Between Cyber Kill Chain process & MITRE ATT&CK framework :
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the Cyber Kill Chain is more focused on the sequential stages of an attack, the MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a broader and more granular view of adversary behavior to inform defensive strategies. 
    Combining both approaches can enhance an organization's overall cybersecurity posture.
