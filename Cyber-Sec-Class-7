  Dicussion : Explained Practical way to do the Port scanning using nmap/zmap tool & Static and Dynamnic IP Address.

What is Static IP ?
===================
Fixed IP which is allocated manually to a system/server is called a Static IP. Ensures that a device has a fixed, known address for reliable and predictable communication.

 How to assign Static IP manually on Windows Laptop :
 ----------------------------------------------------
   Go to COntrol Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connection > Right click on any option (Like Ethernet or Wifi) > choose Properties >  Choose Internet Protocal Version 4 (TCP/IPV4) > Click on below proeprties option,
   > If you choose the following IP Address option and enter the IP it'll add that ip as a static IP(ex : 10.10.10.0) > it'll automatically taken the subnet mask > zthen Choose the Prefered DNS Server & Altrernate DNS Server(It's for HA).

 How to check IP address :
 -----------------------
   Windows(Command Prompt) : ipconfig or ipconfig /all, macOS(Terminal) : ifconfig or ipconfig getifaddr en0, Linux : ifconfig or ip addr show.

 Drawbacks of Static IP:
 =======================
   Manual Configuration and Maintenance:
   -------------------------------------
      Drawback: Assigning and maintaining static IP addresses requires manual intervention by network administrators.
      Example: In a large network with numerous devices, manually configuring each device with a static IP address can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

   Limited Scalability:
   -------------------
      Drawback: Static IP addresses may not scale well in dynamic environments with a frequently changing number of connected devices.
      Example: In a rapidly growing organization where new devices are added regularly, managing static IP assignments for each new device becomes challenging.

   Address Conflict Potential:
   ---------------------------
      Drawback: If an administrator assigns an IP address that is already in use on the network, it can lead to conflicts and connectivity issues.
      Example: If two devices are manually assigned the same static IP address, it can result in network disruptions.
   Reconfiguration Challenges:
   ---------------------------
      Drawback: Changing the IP address of a device or migrating to a new subnet can be cumbersome with static IPs.
      Example: If there's a need to reorganize the network or merge with another network, updating static IP configurations across devices can be complex.
   Security Risks:
   --------------
      Drawback: Static IP addresses may pose security risks if not managed properly, as they can be targeted by attackers.
      Example: An improperly configured firewall or mismanagement of IP address assignments might expose a device with a static IP to potential security threats.

What is DynamicIP-DHCP :
========================
   Meaning : It"ll assign ip addresses automatically by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server using DORA Process with specific period of time. The IP address can change periodically.
   Purpose: Simplifies IP address management by automating the assignment process. Allows efficient utilization of IP addresses in large networks where devices may not be consistently connected.
   Port of DHCP server : 67 & 68

   Diff b/w StaticIP & DynamicIP:
   ------------------------------
    The choice between static and dynamic IP addresses depends on the specific requirements of the network and the devices connected to it. 
    Static IPs provide stability and predictability, while dynamic IPs offer scalability and ease of management in larger and more dynamic network environments.

What is DORA Process :
======================
    The DORA process refers to the four-step sequence in DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which is used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network. 
    The acronym DORA stands for:
      Discover:
        In the Discover step, a client device sends out a broadcast message to discover DHCP servers on the network. 
        This broadcast is usually in the form of a DHCP Discover message, indicating that the client is seeking an IP address and other configuration parameters.
      Offer:
        DHCP servers that receive the Discover message respond with a DHCP Offer. The Offer contains an IP address and other configuration parameters that the server is willing to assign to the client.
        Multiple DHCP servers may respond, and the client typically chooses one of the offered configurations.
      Request:
        The client, having received one or more DHCP Offers, selects one of them and sends a DHCP Request message to the chosen server. 
        This Request message formally requests the offered configuration parameters from the selected DHCP server.
      Acknowledge:
        The DHCP server, upon receiving the Request message, acknowledges the client's request by sending a DHCP Acknowledge (or Ack) message. 
        This message confirms that the client can use the requested configuration parameters, including the assigned IP address. 
        The client now configures its network interface with the received settings.
   Simple Note of DORA Process :
   -----------------------------
     The DORA process ensures an organized and standardized way of dynamically assigning IP addresses and configuring other network parameters.
     It allows for flexibility and efficiency in managing IP addresses in a network, especially in environments with a large number of devices that may come and go dynamically.
