> It's a graphical or pictorial representation how the network devices are deployed in the datacenter or else in the cloud.

> 3 zones in the Networking concept
   Internal/Trust                    (100)
   DMZ/DMG                            (50:50)
   Untrust/External/Public/Internet (Hacker/Attackers are sit here).(0)

> Attacker always try to compromise end user server or they want to compromise the company internal servers.

> Company critical/internal servers are placed/sitting on Trust Zone, Non critical servers are sitting on DMZ/DMG Zone.

> Critical / Non Critical server security :
-------------------------------------------
   For Critical and non-critical servers we should do Vulnerability assessment and hardening This is also called infra security.
   Vulnerability assessment
   Hardening

> EndPoint/EndUser Security :
 ---------------------------
   We can protect All the end User systems and servers by using 
    > AntiViruses/EDR.
    > DLP 
    > FIP : File Integrity Monitoring
    > HIDS/HIPS : 
    > Encryption : Data at rest(Disk protection)
