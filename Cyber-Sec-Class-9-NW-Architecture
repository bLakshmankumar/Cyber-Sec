> It's a graphical or pictorial representation how the network devices are deployed in the datacenter or else in the cloud.

> 3 zones in the Networking concept
   Internal/Trust                    (100)
   DMZ/DMG                            (50:50)
   Untrust/External/Public/Internet (Hacker/Attackers are sit here).(0)

> Attacker always try to compromise end user server or they want to compromise the company internal servers.

> Company critical/internal servers are placed/sitting on Trust Zone, Non critical servers are sitting on DMZ/DMG Zone.

> Critical / Non Critical server security :
-------------------------------------------
   For Critical and non-critical servers we should do Vulnerability assessment and hardening This is also called infra security.
   Vulnerability assessment
   Hardening

> EndPoint/EndUser Security :
 ---------------------------
   We can protect All the end User systems and servers by using 
    > AntiViruses/EDR.
    > DLP 
    > FIP : File Integrity Monitoring
    > HIDS/HIPS : 
    > Encryption : Data at rest(Disk protection) (
    For ex, if you carrying your office laptop and your laptop was stolen by someone, so he can detatch the harddrive and attach the harddrive into other system to stolen the data as well. 
    So that reason we can use the data at rest option to secure the data, even system/server is stolen by attacker, he can't see the original data bcs of encryption.

> Network Security/Perimeter Security/Firewall Security :
---------------------------------------------------------
  We can protect the firewall by using these below tools
    > NIDS/NIPS
    > Proxy (web gateway)

> Application Security :
------------------------
   For application security we use this below solutions
     > WAF ( WAF is a solution, It can prevent against owasp top 10, layer 7 application side attacks).
     > SDLC (We can implement security solutions to all sdlc life cycle phases to provide more security to application).
> Email Gateway : 
-----------------
  Email Gateway is act as a Bridge between Phishing email attacker world to Internal SMTP or Email Server
  Email Gateway will deploy at perimeter level/DMz/DMG zone.

NOTE : SIEM TOol : To monitor all of the network level(all applications, all DB's, all networking, all end user servers, all routers, all emails by 24/7. We can use SIEM TOOL.

> What is inbound Traffic :
---------------------------
   The Traffic is coming untrust(google) to trust device(laptop) is called as inbound traffic.

> What is Outbound Traffic :
----------------------------
   The traffic is going away from trust(laptop) to untrust(Google) is called as outbound traffic.

> Net Flow :
-------------
   The Sum of Inbound Traffic and Out bound traffic is called as Net Flow data.

> Defence in depth :
---------------------
    Defence in depth is a layers level security, Its's a layer approach, If one layer of security controll is bypassing, Second layer will prevent, If second layer will bypass, if third layer will prevent,
    If third layer will bypassing and so on.
    For example like as per Our network diagram First layer FW layer, Then proxy layer, Then NIDS/NIPS layer, Then cs layer, Then AS layer.
    Multiple controlls we will implement.

> DMZ/DMG(Demilitarized Zone/Disk Image): [Simply DMZ/DMG will act as a borader between Trust zone and untrust zone].
-----------------------------------------
 DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): 
    In the context of computer networking and cybersecurity, a DMZ refers to a network segment that is isolated and positioned between an organization's internal network (intranet) and an external network, typically the internet.
    The DMZ is designed to host services that need to be accessible from both the internal and external networks, such as web servers, email servers, or public-facing applications.
    The purpose of a DMZ is to enhance security by segregating external-facing services from the internal network, minimizing the potential impact of security breaches.

 DMG (Disk Image):
    A DMG file is a disk image file format used on macOS. It contains the contents and structure of a disk or storage device and is often used for distributing software or creating backups on Mac computers.
    When a DMG file is opened, it typically mounts as a virtual disk on the user's system, allowing them to access the files within.
    DMG files may be encrypted for added security, and they are commonly used for packaging macOS applications.


# What is Access Switch & Core Switch :
# ===================================== 
     In a networking context, access switches and core switches serve different roles within a network infrastructure. Here's a simple explanation :
     Access Switch:
     --------------
       Role: Access switches primarily connect end-user devices, such as computers, printers, and IP phones, to the local network.
       Functionality: They provide connectivity at the network edge, delivering network access to devices within a specific physical location or network segment.
       Features: Access switches often include features like Power over Ethernet (PoE) for powering connected devices, VLAN support for network segmentation, and basic Layer 2 switching capabilities.
       Example Scenario: In an office building, access switches connect individual workstations, printers, and other devices to the local network.

     Core Switch:
     ------------
       Role: Core switches, also known as backbone switches, form the central part of the network and facilitate communication between different parts of the network.
       Functionality: They handle high-speed data traffic between various access switches and other core devices, such as routers and servers.
       Features: Core switches are designed for high performance, low latency, and often support advanced routing and switching features. They provide the backbone for data transfer within the network.
       Example Scenario: In a large enterprise network, core switches interconnect different departments or buildings, allowing for efficient data exchange between various parts of the organization.

     In Summary:
     -----------
       Access Switch: Connects end-user devices to the local network, providing network access within a specific area or segment.
       Core Switch: Forms the central part of the network, facilitating high-speed data traffic between various access switches and other core devices, ensuring efficient communication across the entire network.
       Both access switches and core switches are integral components of a network, working together to enable effective and scalable communication within an organization. 
       Access switches handle local connections, while core switches manage the backbone infrastructure, ensuring smooth data transfer across the entire network.

# NIDS/NIPS : [ More information available on Cyber-sec-class-13 ]
=============
      * NIDS focuses on network-level detection and alerting.
      * NIPS adds active prevention capabilities at the network level.

# Proxy (web gateway): [ More information available on Cyber-sec-class-13 ]
----------------------
         Role: A proxy server serves as a gateway or intermediary device between client devices and the internet.
         Purpose: It helps control, secure, and optimize network traffic by managing the flow of information between clients and servers.
