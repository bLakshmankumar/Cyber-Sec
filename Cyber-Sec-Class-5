NIC : Network interface card enables computers to connect to local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the internet.
      Also it'll covert electrical signals into data signals.

MAC (Media Access Control) Address : Every NIC Card has physical address. That physical address is called mac address.
    
Mac address bit number is 48bits (it's a combination of charectors & numbers). To get your mac address > Go to command promt > execute getmac command.

1) What is IP Address ? (Ex IP : 10.10.10.0)
-----------------------
   IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. 
   It is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication in an organization.

   NOTE : Binary = 2, Octa = 8, Decimal = 10, Hexa = 16.
   NOTE : Max capacity of an IP address is = 0 or 1
          1 octa - 2 power 8 = means 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 246
   Command to get the ip : ipconfig 

2) What is the subnetmask ?
---------------------------
   
   IP Address : 10.10.10.0/27
   NetworkAddress : 10.10.10
   HostAddress : 0
   Subnetmask : /27
   It means the first 24 bits are reserved for the network (10.10.10), and the last 8 bits are for the host (0). In CIDR notation, this is represented as 10.10.10.0/27.

 > Classifications of IP Addresses : 
  ---------------------------------
   IP addresses are classified based on their structure and the range of addresses they cover.
   There are two main classifications: 
      IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
      IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
   1. IPv4:
    -------
    Meaning: The fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify and locate devices on a network. Additionally, within IPv4, there are three main classes of IP addresses: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
    Structure: Consists of 32 bits, typically represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

   2. IPv6:
   --------
   Meaning: The sixth version of the Internet Protocol, designed to address the limitations of IPv4 and provide a larger address space.
   Structure: Consists of 128 bits, represented as hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

2) Why are we moving the IPV4 to IPV6 ?
---------------------------------------
     2 reasons for the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 
          1) Lack of IPV4 IPs : The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is driven by the limitations of IPv4 and the need for a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
             IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the exponential growth of internet-connected devices, including smartphones, IoT devices, and more, the available IPv4 addresses have become insufficient.

          2) Security : IPv6 incorporates built-in security features, such as IPsec, providing enhanced security capabilities compared to IPv4. This is particularly important for securing communications over the internet.
