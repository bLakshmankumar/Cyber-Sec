NIC : Network interface card enables computers to connect to local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the internet.
      Also it'll covert electrical signals into data signals.

MAC (Media Access Control) Address : Every NIC Card has physical address. That physical address is called mac address.
     Mac address bit number is 48 (it's a combination of charectors & numbers).

IP addresses are classified based on their structure and the range of addresses they cover.
There are two main classifications: 
    IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
    IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

1. IPv4:
Meaning: The fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify and locate devices on a network. Additionally, within IPv4, there are three main classes of IP addresses: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
Structure: Consists of 32 bits, typically represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

2. IPv6:
Meaning: The sixth version of the Internet Protocol, designed to address the limitations of IPv4 and provide a larger address space.
Structure: Consists of 128 bits, represented as hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
