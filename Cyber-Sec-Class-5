NIC : Network interface card enables computers to connect to local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the internet.
      Also it'll covert electrical signals into data signals.

MAC (Media Access Control) Address : Every NIC Card has physical address. That physical address is called mac address.
    
Mac address bit number is 48bits (it's a combination of charectors & numbers). To get your mac address > Go to command promt > execute getmac command.

1) What is IP Address ? (Ex IP : 10.10.10.0)
-----------------------
   IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. 
   It is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication in an organization.

   NOTE : Binary = 2, Octa = 8, Decimal = 10, Hexa = 16.
   NOTE : Max capacity of an IP address is = 0 or 1
          1 octa - 2 power 8 = means 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 246
   Command to get the ip : ipconfig 

2) What is Subnet ?
-------------------
   A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, while a subnet mask is a numeric representation that determines the division between the network and host portions of an IP address within that subnet.

3) What is the subnetmask ?
---------------------------
   The subnet mask is a critical component of the subnetting process, as it defines how the IP address space is partitioned, making it possible to have multiple subnets within a larger network.
   IP Address : 10.10.10.0/27
   NetworkAddress : 10.10.10
   HostAddress : 0
   Subnetmask : /27
   It means the first 24 bits are reserved for the network (10.10.10), and the last 8 bits are for the host (0). In CIDR notation, this is represented as 10.10.10.0/27.

 > Versions of IP Addresses : 
  ---------------------------------
   IP addresses are classified based on their structure and the range of addresses they cover.
   There are two main classifications: 
      IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
      IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
   1. IPv4:
    -------
    Meaning: The fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify and locate devices on a network. Additionally, within IPv4, there are three main classes of IP addresses: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
    Structure: Consists of 32 bits, typically represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

   2. IPv6:
   --------
   Meaning: The sixth version of the Internet Protocol, designed to address the limitations of IPv4 and provide a larger address space.
   Structure: Consists of 128 bits, represented as hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

4) Why are we moving the IPV4 to IPV6 ?
---------------------------------------
     2 reasons for the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 
          1) Lack of IPV4 IPs : The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is driven by the limitations of IPv4 and the need for a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
             IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the exponential growth of internet-connected devices, including smartphones, IoT devices, and more, the available IPv4 addresses have become insufficient.

          2) Security : IPv6 incorporates built-in security features, such as IPsec, providing enhanced security capabilities compared to IPv4. This is particularly important for securing communications over the internet.

5) Types of IP Addresses ?
----------------------------
     Public IP Addressses : Public address is accessable by everyone.
     Private Ip address : Private Ip can be accessable by internal team.
     These IP addresses are assigned by IANA = Internet assigned number authority.

6) How to identify public and private ip addresses ?
----------------------------------------------------
    Public and private IP addresses are distinguished based on specific address ranges defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

7) Classification of IP addresses(Public + Private) :
-----------------------------------------------------
   IP addresses are classified into five classes. These classes were part of the original design of the IPv4 addressing scheme, and they are defined based on the leading bits of the IP address. 
   Each class has a different range of IP addresses for both network and host identification.
   
    Class A  : Range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255    : Usage: Typically used for large organizations or ISPs with a vast number of hosts.
    Class B  : Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255  : Usage: Suitable for medium-sized networks, such as universities or large companies.
    Class C  : Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255  : Usage: Commonly used for smaller networks, like small businesses or local area networks (LANs).
    Class D  : Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255  : Usage: Addresses in this range are used for multicasting/multitasking, where a single packet is sent to multiple recipients.
    Class E  : Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255  : Usage: Addresses in this range are reserved for experimental and research purposes and are not intended for general use.
    Look back/Local address : 127.0.0.1

8) Private IP Addresses ?
-------------------------
   Class A : Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
   Class B : Range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
   Class C : Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
 Otherthan above ranges of ip addresses we can all it as public ip address.

9) What is insider threat/internal attack ?
--------------------------------------------
   If the hacking is hapenning from internal employ, that is called insider threat/internal attack.

10) What is an external atatck ?
--------------------------------
   The hacking is hapenning from the external attackers or intruders or threat actors or adversary is called as external attack.
