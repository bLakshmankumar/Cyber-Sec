# Will discuss top 10 attacks as per 2021 data [ https://owasp.org/Top10/ ] :
=============================================================================
    A01:2021-Broken Access Control :
         Definition: Broken access control refers to the failure to enforce proper restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
         Example Attack: An attacker could manipulate the URL or change parameters in a request to access unauthorized resources or perform actions not intended for their role, such as accessing another user's account information.
         Mitigation: Implement proper access controls, including role-based access control (RBAC), enforce least privilege principles, and perform regular security assessments and access control audits.
                     For example, ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to by checking their permissions and roles before granting access.

    A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures : 
         Cryptographic Failures refer to weaknesses or errors in cryptographic implementations, leading to vulnerabilities such as data breaches or system compromise.
         Mitigation: Use strong encryption algorithms and cryptographic protocols. Implement secure key management practices and ensure proper configuration of cryptographic libraries.
         Example: If an application stores passwords in plain text or uses weak encryption algorithms, it is vulnerable to cryptographic failures. 
                 would involve securely hashing passwords using algorithms like bcrypt and ensuring sensitive data is encrypted properly.

  * A03:2021-Injection Flaw attack :
         Definition: Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is inserted into a command or query, allowing attackers to execute malicious code or commands.
                     94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3.37%,
                     and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications with 274k occurrences. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition.
         Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks. Implement input validation and sanitization to filter out malicious input.
         Typed of injections : SQL Injection (SQLi), Command Injection, LDAP Injection, XML Injection (XQuery Injection, XPath Injection), OS Command Injection, XPath Injection.
         Example: SQL injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL commands into input fields, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data from the database or manipulate its contents.

    A04:2021-Insecure Design :
         Definition: Insecure Design refers to flaws in the design of an application that make it vulnerable to various attacks. These flaws cannot be fixed solely through code changes.
         Mitigation: Conduct thorough threat modeling and utilize secure design patterns and principles. Define security requirements early in the development process and ensure they are followed throughout.
         Example: If an application lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms from the beginning, it is vulnerable to insecure design. Mitigation involves redesigning the application architecture to incorporate secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

    A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration :
         Definition: Security Misconfiguration occurs when security settings are improperly configured, leaving vulnerabilities exposed. This can include default configurations, unnecessary features enabled, or missing security patches.
         Mitigation: Follow security best practices for configuring servers, frameworks, and applications. Regularly audit configurations and apply security patches promptly.
         Example: Leaving default passwords unchanged or exposing sensitive information in error messages are examples of security misconfigurations. Mitigation involves changing default passwords and configuring error messages to reveal minimal information.

    A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components :
         Definition: Vulnerable and Outdated Components refer to the usage of third-party libraries or software components with known security vulnerabilities.
         Mitigation: Regularly update and patch third-party components. Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies and remove or replace outdated components.
         Example: Using an outdated version of a web framework with known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to potential exploits. Mitigation involves updating to the latest version of the framework or replacing it with a more secure alternative.

    A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures : 
         Definition: Identification and Authentication Failures occur when authentication mechanisms fail to properly identify and authenticate users, leading to unauthorized access.
         Mitigation: Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforce proper credential management practices.
         Example: Weak password policies or lack of multi-factor authentication can lead to identification and authentication failures. Mitigation involves enforcing strong password policies and implementing MFA.

    A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures :
         Definition: Software and Data Integrity Failures occur when assumptions related to software updates, critical data, or CI/CD pipelines are made without verifying integrity, leading to potential compromises.
         Mitigation: Implement integrity checks for software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines. Verify the integrity of all components before deploying them.
         Example: If a malicious actor compromises a CI/CD pipeline and injects malicious code into the production environment, it results in software and data integrity failures. Mitigation involves implementing strong controls to prevent unauthorized changes to critical components.

    A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures :
        Definition: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures occur when logging and monitoring mechanisms are insufficient, making it challenging to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
        Mitigation: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions. Ensure logs are generated for all security-relevant events and establish real-time alerting mechanisms.
        Example: If an application fails to log failed authentication attempts or unusual access patterns, it becomes difficult to detect potential security breaches. Mitigation involves implementing logging for all security-relevant events and establishing real-time alerts for suspicious activities.

    A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery :
       Definition: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when an attacker can make the web server send requests to arbitrary destinations controlled by the attacker.
       Mitigation: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from manipulating server-side requests. Use whitelisting to restrict the destinations the server can access.
       Example: If an application allows users to specify a URL for server-side processing and does not validate the input properly, it is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Mitigation involves validating and sanitizing input to prevent attackers from controlling server-side requests.

Other Imp Attacks : 
====================
 * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
   ----------------------------------
     Definition: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into unknowingly executing malicious actions on a web application in which the user is authenticated.
     How it Works: Attackers exploit CSRF vulnerabilities by tricking victims into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link that performs actions on a target website where the victim is authenticated. The attacker leverages the victim's active session to execute unauthorized actions without their consent.
     Example Attack: An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing hidden form fields that mimic legitimate requests to a banking website. The attacker then lures the victim into visiting this page, causing their browser to automatically submit the form and transfer funds from their account to the attacker's account.
    Mitigation:
      Implement anti-CSRF tokens or nonces (unique, unpredictable values) in forms and requests to validate the origin of requests and prevent unauthorized actions.
      Use SameSite cookies to restrict cookie scope and prevent CSRF attacks originating from third-party websites.
      Educate users about the risks of clicking on unfamiliar links or visiting suspicious websites and encourage them to log out of sensitive accounts when not in use.
    Example Mitigation:
      Web developers can include CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests to validate the origin of requests and reject those that do not include a valid token. 
      For example, a banking website may include a hidden CSRF token in each form submission, which is validated on the server side before processing the request.
  
   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):
   -------------------------
     Definition: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties without their knowledge.
     How it Works: Attackers insert themselves between the communication flow of two parties, intercepting and potentially modifying the data being exchanged.
                  This can occur in various scenarios, such as insecure Wi-Fi networks, compromised routers, or malicious software.
     Example Attack: An attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with a legitimate-sounding name in a public area. When unsuspecting users connect to this access point, the attacker can intercept their traffic, including sensitive information like login credentials or financial data.
       Mitigation:
         Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS, SSH, or VPNs to encrypt data in transit and prevent interception.
         Employ techniques like certificate pinning and mutual authentication to verify the identities of communicating parties and detect MitM attacks.
         Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks and encourage them to use trusted connections and security best practices.
       Example Mitigation: 
         Organizations can implement strict firewall rules to block unauthorized network traffic and detect and log suspicious activities indicative of MitM attacks.
         For example, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be configured to alert administrators when unusual network traffic patterns are detected.

   Buffer Overflow:
   ----------------
     Definition: Buffer overflow is a type of vulnerability where a program writes more data to a buffer (temporary storage area) than it can hold, leading to memory corruption and potential execution of malicious code.
     How it Works: Attackers exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted input data to a program, causing it to overwrite adjacent memory locations with malicious code. This code can then be executed to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.
     Example Attack: An attacker may exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a web server by sending a carefully crafted HTTP request containing excessive data. This can overwrite critical memory structures, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
      Mitigation:
        Use programming languages that provide memory safety features, such as bounds checking.
        Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that only expected data is accepted.
        Employ techniques like address space layout randomization (ASLR) and stack canaries to make it harder for attackers to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
      Example Mitigation:
        Update vulnerable software with patches provided by vendors to fix known buffer overflow vulnerabilities. For example, if a web server software is found to have a buffer overflow vulnerability, the vendor may release a patch to address the issue.

   Session Hijacking:
   ------------------
     Definition: Session hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts and takes over an active session between a user and a web application, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.
     How it Works: Attackers can hijack sessions by stealing session identifiers, such as session cookies, through various means like packet sniffing, session fixation, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Once obtained, the attacker can use these identifiers to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.
     Example Attack: An attacker intercepts network traffic between a user and a web application using a tool like Wireshark. They identify and capture the session cookie sent by the application during login. With this cookie, the attacker can then impersonate the user and access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.
       Mitigation:
         Implement secure session management practices, such as using HTTPS to encrypt traffic and secure cookies with flags like Secure and HttpOnly.
         Employ mechanisms like session expiration, re-authentication for sensitive actions, and IP address verification to detect and prevent session hijacking attempts.
         Use techniques like session token rotation and cryptographic measures to make session identifiers resistant to theft and replay attacks.
       Example Mitigation: 
         Implementing session tokens with short expiration times and regularly rotating them can limit the window of opportunity for attackers to hijack sessions. For example, a web application may generate a new session token for each login and invalidate old tokens after a short period of inactivity.

 * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) :  
   ----------------------------
     Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. 
     These scripts can execute within the victim's browser, leading to unauthorized access to cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, as well as the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    There are mainly three types of XSS attacks:
    --------------------------------------------
      Reflected XSS: In this type of attack, the malicious script is injected into the web application and then reflected off the web server to the victim's browser. This often happens through URLs or form inputs where the injected script is part of the request and gets executed by the victim's browser.
      Stored XSS: Also known as persistent XSS, in this attack, the injected script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a command and control server database. When a user visits the affected page, the script is served from the server and executed in the victim's browser. 
                  In such a way attacker will gain an unauthorised access or sensitive data exposur.
      DOM-based XSS: This type of XSS occurs when the vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than on the server. The attacker manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) environment in the victim's browser to execute the malicious script.

    Now, let's see how XSS attacks work:
    ------------------------------------
     Injection: The attacker identifies a vulnerability in a web application that allows them to inject malicious scripts. This could be through input fields, URL parameters, or other entry points where user-controlled data is not properly sanitized.
     Execution: Once the malicious script is injected, it gets served to other users visiting the affected page. When the victim's browser renders the page, it executes the injected script within the context of the web application.
     Exploitation: The executed script can perform various actions depending on the attacker's goals. This may include stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

    Now, let's discuss mitigation techniques with a real-time example:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
     Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious scripts. This can include filtering out or escaping special characters that could be used in XSS attacks.
     Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load content, including scripts. This can help prevent XSS attacks by limiting the execution of scripts to trusted sources.
     Output Encoding: Encode user-generated content before displaying it in web pages. This helps prevent the browser from interpreting the content as executable scripts.
     Session Management: Use secure session management practices, such as HTTPOnly cookies, to prevent XSS attacks from stealing session tokens.
     Security Testing: Regularly perform security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address XSS vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
   Real-Time Example:
   ------------------
     Suppose you have a web application that allows users to post comments on a forum. Without proper input validation and sanitization, an attacker could inject a malicious script into a comment.
     When other users visit the page and view the comment, their browsers would execute the injected script, potentially compromising their accounts or stealing their session tokens.
     To mitigate this, the web application should validate and sanitize all user inputs, including comments, to ensure they do not contain malicious scripts. Additionally, implementing CSP headers and output encoding can provide additional layers of defense against XSS attacks. 
     Regular security testing should also be conducted to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the application.

* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) :
--------------------------------------
     It is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications that allows attackers to send arbitrary requests from the vulnerable server. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data theft, or other malicious actions. 
     SSRF attacks typically exploit functionalities that allow the application to make HTTP requests to other resources, such as APIs or internal systems.
   Here's how SSRF attacks work:
   -----------------------------
      Identifying Vulnerability: The attacker identifies a SSRF vulnerability in the target web application. This could be through analyzing the application's functionality or by using automated scanning tools.
      Exploiting the Vulnerability: The attacker crafts a malicious request, often by providing a URL as input to the application. This URL points to a resource that the attacker wants to access, such as an internal server or a cloud metadata endpoint.
      Sending the Request: The attacker submits the malicious request to the vulnerable application. The application processes the request and sends a request to the specified URL, typically unaware that it is controlled by the attacker.
      Exploiting the Response: Depending on the response from the targeted resource, the attacker can gather sensitive information, manipulate internal systems, or escalate the attack further.

   Now, let's discuss mitigation techniques with a real-time example:
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Mitigation Techniques:
   ----------------------
     Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user-controlled input to prevent attackers from providing malicious URLs that can be used in SSRF attacks. This includes checking input formats, whitelisting allowed domains, and blocking requests to internal or sensitive resources.
     Restricting Access: Limit the network access of the application to only necessary resources and endpoints. Use firewalls, network segmentation, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to internal systems.
     URL Whitelisting: Maintain a whitelist of allowed URLs or domains that the application can access. Block requests to URLs outside of the whitelist to prevent attackers from exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities.
     Use of Secure APIs: If the application needs to make requests to external resources, use secure APIs with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Avoid using user-controlled input directly in requests without proper validation.
     Monitoring and Logging: Monitor outgoing requests from the application for unusual or suspicious behavior. Log and analyze all requests made by the application to detect and investigate potential SSRF attacks.

   Real-Time Example:
   ------------------
     Suppose you have a web application that allows users to upload images and provides a feature to resize images by fetching them from a URL. Without proper input validation and access controls, an attacker could exploit this functionality to perform an SSRF attack.
     To mitigate this, the application should validate and sanitize all user-controlled inputs, including URLs provided for image resizing. Additionally, restrict the application's access to only necessary resources and endpoints, and use URL whitelisting to block requests to unauthorized domains.
     Regular monitoring and logging of outgoing requests can also help detect and prevent SSRF attacks in real-time.

# Types of Injection Flaw Attacks :
===================================
    Injection flaws are a common type of vulnerability in web applications where untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended execution of malicious code. Here are some common types of injection flaw attacks:
    1. SQL Injection (SQLi):
         Description: SQL injection occurs when attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields of a web application, manipulating the SQL queries executed by the backend database.
         Objective: The goal is usually to extract sensitive data from the database, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
         Example: An attacker may input 1' OR '1'='1 into a login form, manipulating the SQL query to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.
    2. Command Injection:
        Description: Command injection occurs when attackers inject malicious commands into input fields or parameters that are passed to system commands or shell scripts.
        Objective: The goal is typically to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, leading to unauthorized access or system compromise.
        Example: An attacker may input ; rm -rf / into a search field of a web application vulnerable to command injection, leading to the deletion of critical system files.
    3. LDAP Injection:
        Description: LDAP injection occurs when attackers manipulate LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) queries by injecting malicious input into search filters or other parameters.
        Objective: Attackers aim to extract or modify data stored in LDAP directories, bypass authentication mechanisms, or perform unauthorized actions.
        Example: An attacker may input *)(uid=admin)(password=*) into a login form, manipulating the LDAP query to authenticate without a valid password.
    4. XML Injection (XQuery Injection, XPath Injection):
        Description: XML injection occurs when attackers inject malicious input into XML data or queries, exploiting vulnerabilities in XML processing functionalities.
        Objective: The goal is often to manipulate XML documents, extract sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code.
        Example: An attacker may input '; DROP TABLE users;-- into an XML input field, causing the backend application to execute a destructive SQL query when processing the XML data.
    5. OS Command Injection:
        Description: OS command injection occurs when attackers inject malicious operating system commands into input fields or parameters used by the application to interact with the underlying operating system.
        Objective: Attackers aim to execute unauthorized commands on the operating system, leading to system compromise or unauthorized access.
        Example: An attacker may input | cat /etc/passwd into a web application's input field vulnerable to OS command injection, allowing them to read the contents of the password file.
    6. XPath Injection:
        Description: XPath injection occurs when attackers manipulate XPath queries by injecting malicious input into input fields or parameters used for XML data processing.
        Objective: Attackers aim to manipulate XML data, extract sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code.
        Example: An attacker may input '] | //user[password=" into a search field, manipulating the XPath query to retrieve user data without proper authentication.
        
        These are some of the most common types of injection flaws, each with its own attack vectors, objectives, and potential impact on the security of web applications and underlying systems.
        Mitigating injection flaws requires implementing proper input validation, parameterized queries, and other security best practices to prevent malicious input from being executed by the application.
