# Here we will discuss about what is the Process of Incident Investigation :
============================================================================

1) ITIL Framework (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) :
-----------------------------------------------------------------
     Focuses on IT service management and aligning IT services with business needs.
     This process is commonly used by service or consulting based companies. 
     EX : Infosys, TCS, HCL & etc.

     ITIL focuses on the entire IT service lifecycle, from the initial strategy and design to transition, operation, and continual improvement. 
     The primary goal is to ensure that IT services meet the business requirements and contribute to overall business success.

  > Different trypes of processes falls under ITIL :
  --------------------------------------------------
    Within the ITIL framework, various processes are defined to address different aspects of IT service management. 
    Some of the key processes include:
      - Incident Lifecycle management process : Focuses on the timely resolution of incidents (unplanned interruptions or reductions in quality) to minimize the impact on business operations.
      - Change Management Process             : Aims to control and manage changes to the IT environment in a systematic and efficient manner, reducing the risk of service disruptions.
      - Problem Statement                     : Focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of recurring incidents to prevent them from happening in the future.
      - Solution statement                    : Encompasses the broader set of processes and activities related to delivering and managing IT services, including project delivery, service transition, and overall service operation.
      - Project Delivery or service delivery
  
2) NIST Frameworks (National Institute of Standards and Technology) :
--------------------------------------------------------------------
     NIST primarily focuses on cybersecurity risk management and resilience, providing standards and guidelines for enhancing the security and competitiveness of organizations.
     It is widely used across various sectors, including both product-based and service-based companies.
     Ex : Google, Facebook, IBM & TCS, Infosys & etc.

  --------------------------------------------------
      - RMF (Risk Management Framework)
      ----------------------------------
          Definition: RMF is a structured process designed to manage and improve the cybersecurity posture of an organization. It provides a framework for managing information security risks and is applicable to both federal and non-federal organizations.
          Key Steps in RMF:
            Prepare: Establish the context, priorities, and resources for the risk management process.
            Categorize: Identify and classify information systems and the information processed based on impact levels.
            Select: Choose appropriate security controls for the identified risks.
            Implement: Implement the selected security controls.
            Assess: Evaluate the effectiveness of the security controls.
            Authorize: Grant or deny authorization to operate based on the risk assessment.
            Monitor: Continuously monitor and respond to changes in the risk environment.
      
      - Incident life cycle management process :
      ------------------------------------------
          Definition: This process focuses on managing the entire lifecycle of cybersecurity incidents. It includes identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
          Key Stages in Incident Lifecycle Management:
            Identification: Detecting and recognizing potential incidents.
            Containment: Taking actions to prevent the incident from spreading.
            Eradication: Removing the root cause of the incident.
            Recovery: Restoring affected systems and services.
            Lessons Learned: Analyzing the incident to improve future incident response.
      
      - Fips Compliances (Federal Information Processing Standards) :
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
          Definition: FIPS are a set of standards developed by NIST for use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and government contractors. FIPS compliance ensures that systems and processes meet specific security and interoperability standards.
          Key Aspects of FIPS Compliance:
            Cryptography: Specifies cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
            Security Requirements: Defines security requirements for various systems and components.
            Interoperability: Ensures that systems can work together seamlessly.
            Physical Security: Addresses physical security controls.

# GAP Analysis :
================
   GAP analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify the difference or "gap" between a company's current security performance and its desired security performance. 
   It involves comparing where an organization is currently to where it wants to be in the future.
