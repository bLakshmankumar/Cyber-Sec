DNS Servers & Records :
======================

What is DNS : 
------------
   DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it serves as a crucial component of the internet infrastructure. 
   Its primary purpose is to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other over the internet.

Purpose:
-------
   Human-Readable Addresses: DNS allows us to use easily memorable domain names (like www.example.com) instead of dealing with numerical IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). This makes it simpler for users to navigate the internet.
   Hierarchical Structure: DNS organizes domain names in a hierarchical structure, making it scalable and easier to manage.
                           It resembles a tree-like structure, with the root at the top, followed by top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and so on.
   Distributed Database: DNS acts as a distributed database, distributing the responsibility of storing and managing domain information across numerous DNS servers worldwide.

How It Works:
-------------
   DNS Resolution: When you enter a domain name into your browser, your device initiates a DNS resolution process to find the corresponding IP address.
   DNS Queries: The process begins with a DNS query. Your device sends a request to a local DNS resolver (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider - ISP).
   Caching: The local resolver may have the IP address in its cache if the domain has been recently accessed. If not, it forwards the request to a series of DNS servers.
   Root DNS Servers: The query starts at the root DNS servers, which direct the resolver to the TLD DNS servers (e.g., .com, .org).
   TLD DNS Servers: The TLD servers then guide the resolver to the authoritative DNS servers for the specific domain.
   Authoritative DNS Servers: These servers hold the accurate and up-to-date information about the domain's IP address.
   Response: The authoritative server sends the IP address back to the resolver, which, in turn, communicates it to your device.
   Caching Again: The resolver often caches the obtained IP address to speed up future requests for the same domain.

DNS Records:
------------
  DNS databases store information in records, each serving a specific purpose. Common types of DNS records include:
    A (Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
    AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
    CNAME (Canonical Name) Record: Provides an alias for another domain.
    MX (Mail Exchange) Record: Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving email.
