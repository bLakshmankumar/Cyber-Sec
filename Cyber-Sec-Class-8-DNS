DNS Servers & Records :
======================

What is DNS : 
------------
   DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it serves as a crucial component of the internet infrastructure. 
   Its primary purpose is to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other over the internet.

Protocal :
----------
   DNS Port no : 53 (It'll support for both tcp/udp connections).

Purpose:
-------
   Human-Readable Addresses: DNS allows us to use easily memorable domain names (like www.example.com) instead of dealing with numerical IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). This makes it simpler for users to navigate the internet.
   Hierarchical Structure: DNS organizes domain names in a hierarchical structure, making it scalable and easier to manage.
                           It resembles a tree-like structure, with the root at the top, followed by top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and so on.
   Distributed Database: DNS acts as a distributed database, distributing the responsibility of storing and managing domain information across numerous DNS servers worldwide.

How It Works:
-------------
   DNS Resolution: When you enter a domain name into your browser, your device initiates a DNS resolution process to find the corresponding IP address.
   DNS Queries: The process begins with a DNS query. Your device sends a request to a local DNS resolver (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider - ISP).
   Caching: The local resolver may have the IP address in its cache if the domain has been recently accessed. If not, it forwards the request to a series of DNS servers.
   Root DNS Servers: The query starts at the root DNS servers, which direct the resolver to the TLD DNS servers (e.g., .com, .org).
   TLD DNS Servers: The TLD servers then guide the resolver to the authoritative DNS servers for the specific domain.
   Authoritative DNS Servers: These servers hold the accurate and up-to-date information about the domain's IP address.
   Response: The authoritative server sends the IP address back to the resolver, which, in turn, communicates it to your device.
   Caching Again: The resolver often caches the obtained IP address to speed up future requests for the same domain.

DNS Backend Process in simple : 
-------------------------------
   Once end user giving any domain name request to dns server, DNS server will validate whether it is blocklisted or whitelisted domain.
   If it's block listed dns server will respond to internal user stating that domain name can't access.
   If it's a whitelisted domain name, DNS server will validate in the cache of DNS server and if it's available it'll respond back to the end user, then end user is able to access the website/domain name.
   If domain name is whitelisted but not existing in the Cache then DNS Server will forward the request to Backend authorativeserver and authoritative server will validate once again block listed.

DNS Records:
------------
  DNS databases store information in records, each serving a specific purpose. Common types of DNS records include:
    A (Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
    AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
    CNAME (Canonical Name) Record: Provides an alias for another domain. It'll convert one form of web-browser into other-form of browser.
    MX (Mail Exchange) Record: Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving email.
    PTR Record : (Reverse Pointer) : PTR records will convert IPv4 or IPV6 IP addresses to domain names.
    TXT Record : Record used to store arbitrary text data associated with a domain.
                 Every email contains couple of important parameters or features : SPF(Sender Policy Framework), DKIM(Domain key identification message), DK(Domain Keys)-(Public & Private).
    HINFO Record : The HINFO (Host Information) record is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record used to provide information about the hardware and operating system used by a particular host (computer) on the internet.
                   EX : What is the CPU utilization of our DNS server, like RAM, HDD, SDD, Generation, ModelNumber.
    SOA Record : The SOA record designates the primary authoritative DNS server for a specific DNS zone. It contains essential information about the management of the zone.
                 It Contents details such as the primary master name server, the responsible party's email address, a serial number, and various timing intervals for zone maintenance (refresh, retry, expire, and minimum TTL).
    NS Record :  The NS record specifies the authoritative DNS servers responsible for a domain. It indicates which DNS servers hold the authoritative information for resolving queries related to that domain.
                 It directing DNS resolvers to the servers responsible for resolving queries related to that domain.

Top DNS attacks and strategies to defend :
------------------------------------------
  DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical component of the internet, and it's a common target for various types of attacks.
    1) DNS Spoofing (DNS Cache Poisoning):
    --------------------------------------
         Attack Description: Attackers attempt to insert malicious DNS records into the cache of a DNS resolver, redirecting legitimate traffic to malicious sites.
         Defense: Use DNSSEC: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digitally signs DNS data, preventing the modification of DNS records and ensuring data integrity. 
                  Regularly flush DNS caches to remove potentially poisoned entries.
    2) DNS Amplification Attack:
    ---------------------------
         Attack Description: Attackers exploit misconfigured DNS servers to amplify a small DNS query into a larger response, overwhelming the target with traffic.
         Defense: Implement Rate Limiting: Set up rate limiting on DNS servers to prevent abuse and limit the number of responses per second. 
                  Validate and filter incoming DNS requests to identify and block suspicious queries.
    3) DNS DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):
    --------------------------------------------
         Attack Description: Overwhelm DNS servers with a massive volume of traffic, rendering them unavailable for legitimate users.
         Defense: Use Anycast DNS: Distribute DNS services across multiple geographically dispersed servers using Anycast. This helps absorb DDoS traffic.
                  Deploy DDoS mitigation services or appliances to identify and filter malicious traffic.
    4) DNS Tunneling:
    -----------------
         Attack Description: Malicious actors use DNS queries and responses to create covert communication channels, bypassing traditional security measures.
         Defense: Monitor DNS Traffic: Regularly inspect DNS traffic for unusual patterns and detect anomalies that might indicate tunneling activities.
         Employ DNS filtering solutions to block known malicious domains and prevent tunneling attempts.
    5) DNS Hijacking:
    -----------------
         Attack Description: Attackers gain unauthorized access to DNS records, redirecting traffic away from its intended destination.
         Defense: Enable DNSSEC: DNSSEC helps protect against DNS hijacking by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses.
                  Use strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to DNS management interfaces.
    6) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:
    -----------------------------------
         Attack Description: Interceptors position themselves between the user and DNS server, intercepting and manipulating DNS traffic.
         Defense: Encrypt DNS Traffic: Implement DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to encrypt DNS queries, making it difficult for attackers to intercept and manipulate.
                  Monitor for unusual behavior and use network security tools to detect and prevent MitM attacks.
   7) Domain Kiting and Domain Tasting:
   ------------------------------------
         Attack Description: Abusing domain registration grace periods to test and exploit domains without incurring costs.
         Defense: Implement Rate Limiting: Apply rate limiting to domain registrations to prevent excessive registrations within short periods.
         Monitor domain registrations and identify suspicious patterns.
   8) Pharming:
   ------------
         Attack Description: Redirecting website traffic to a fraudulent site without the user's knowledge, often through DNS manipulation.
         Defense: Monitor DNS responses for unexpected changes and anomalies. Use DNS filtering to block access to known phishing or fraudulent domains.

Types of DNS Servers : 
======================
    We have 2 types DNS servers 1) Public DNS server  2) Private DNS Server
    Public DNS server : 
    -------------------
       Purpose: Public DNS servers are designed to resolve domain names for everyone on the internet. 
                They translate human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses so that users can access websites and online services.
       Usage: Individuals, ISPs (Internet Service Providers), and organizations use public DNS servers to access content on the internet.
    Private DNS Server :
    --------------------
       Purpose: Private DNS servers are used within private networks, such as corporate or organizational networks. They handle queries for internal domain names and resources that are not publicly accessible.
       Usage: Organizations use private DNS servers to manage and resolve domain names within their internal networks. It's commonly used for intranet services and internal systems.
    Simply :
    --------
       Public DNS Servers: Resolve domain names for the entire internet. Used for general internet access.
       Private DNS Servers: Resolve domain names within a private network. Used for internal services and resources.
