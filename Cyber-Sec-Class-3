 > ARP : Address Resolution Protocol. Its purpose is to map an IP address to a corresponding physical (MAC) address on a local network.
         ARP is used to dynamically discover the hardware address (MAC address) associated with a given IP address within a local network.
         Example: When a device needs to communicate with another device on the same local network, it uses ARP to resolve the IP address to the MAC address, allowing for proper data transmission.
 
 > RARP : RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. Its purpose is to map a MAC address to an IP address, which is the reverse of what ARP does.
          Example: In diskless workstations that need an IP address to boot over a network, RARP can be used to obtain the IP address associated with the workstation's MAC address.

 > TCP : Transmission Control Protocol. Its purpose is to provide reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices over a network.
         Example: When you download a file from a server, TCP ensures that all parts of the file are received correctly, and if any packet is lost, it is retransmitted for complete and accurate data transfer.

 > UDP : User Datagram Protocol. UDP is designed for simplicity and efficiency, providing a lightweight, connectionless communication method that does not guarantee reliable delivery.
         Example: Online gaming often uses UDP for its low-latency characteristics. In gaming, rapid communication of small packets is prioritized over guaranteed delivery, as a slight delay is preferable to a stalled game.
