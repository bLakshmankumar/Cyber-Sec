Abbrivations/Acronyms In Cyber-Security :
=========================================
 > LAN : Local Area Network [ Local Area Network is a network of interconnected computers and devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus.
         LANs allow these devices to communicate with each other and share resources, such as files, printers, and internet connections].
 > WAN : Wide Are Network [ WAN is a type of Geographical network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple smaller networks, such as Local Area Networks (LANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).
         The primary purpose of a WAN is to facilitate communication and data exchange between geographically distant locations with internet]
 > MAN :  Metropolitan Area Network [ MANs typically cover a city or a large campus, connecting multiple buildings and LANs within a specific metropolitan area].
 > DC  : Data Center [ A data center is a facility used to manage computer systems, servers, networking equipment, and components for the purpose of processing, storing, and managing large amounts of data.
         Data centers play a crucial role in supporting the operations of organizations by providing a secure and controlled environment for IT infrastructure.
 > DC  : Domain Controller [ A Domain Controller (DC) is a server in a Windows Server-based network that manages security authentication and authorization, as well as organizes and centralizes network resources. 
         It plays a key role in a Windows Active Directory (AD) environment, which is a directory service used to store and organize information about network resources].
         It's managed/Controlled by Windows admin team/System admin team.

   > Difference Between Authentication & Authorization : 
  ======================================================
      Authentication : Authentication is the process of verifying someone's identity. It's like confirming that you are who you say you are.
                       For example, when you log into a website by entering your username and password, you are authenticating yourself.
      Authorization : Authorization, on the other hand, is about determining what actions someone is allowed to perform after they've been authenticated. 
                      It's like deciding what permissions or access rights you have once your identity is confirmed. For instance, after logging into a system, 
                      authorization decides whether you have the right to view, edit, or delete specific files or data.
 > AV : Anti Virus [ An antivirus (or anti-virus) is a type of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, commonly known as malware, from computer systems.
        The primary purpose of antivirus software is to protect computers and networks from various types of harmful programs, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, and other forms of malicious code.
        [Simply Virus is an Attack and Anti Virus is a Solution for that attack]
 > AM : Anti Malware [ "Anti-malware" is a broad term that encompasses various types of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove different forms of malicious software, commonly known as malware.
        Malware is a generic term for any software intentionally created to harm, exploit, or compromise computer systems, networks, or user data.
        Anti-malware tools are developed to protect computer systems from a range of threats, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, and other types of harmful code.
 > EDR : Endpoint Detection and Response(Advanced technology) [It is a category of cybersecurity tools and solutions that focus on detecting and responding to security incidents at the endpoint level.
        Endpoints refer to individual devices such as desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices in a network]

 > DLP : Data Loss/Leak Prevention [DLP is a set of tools and processes designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or transmission of sensitive information. 
         The primary goal of DLP is to protect sensitive data from being accidentally or intentionally leaked or exposed to unauthorized individuals or entities].

 > FIM : FIM stands for File Integrity Monitoring. It is a security feature and process that involves monitoring and validating the integrity of files on a computer system. The primary goal of File Integrity Monitoring is to detect and alert on any unauthorized or unexpected changes to critical system files, configuration files, and directories.
         This helps in identifying potential security incidents, such as unauthorized modifications, malware infections, or system compromises.
         All malware related attacks comes from files, every file has unique has value, even someone trying to add, delete, modify any file we should monitor what they are trying to do.
 
 > IDS : IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System. An Intrusion Detection System is a security tool or device that monitors network or system activities for malicious or suspicious behavior and alerts administrators or security personnel when such activities are detected. It'll detect but It won't block the attack.

 > IPS : IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System. An Intrusion Prevention System is a security solution designed to monitor, detect, and actively prevent unauthorized access, attacks, or security breaches on a network or system. 
         IPS builds upon the capabilities of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by not only identifying malicious activities but also taking automated actions to block or mitigate those activities in real-time.
 
 > HIPS & HIDS : (These are works on Host level)
------------------------------------------------
         HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System) actively blocks and prevents security threats in real-time, automatically taking actions to stop malicious activities. It'll work on host level
         HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) detects and alerts on suspicious behavior but does not proactively prevent threats, requiring manual intervention for response. It'll also work on host level.

 > NIPS & NIDS : (These works on Network level)
-----------------------------------------------
          NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System) actively blocks and prevents malicious network activities in real-time, enhancing security by automatically taking measures to stop threats. It works on Network level.
          NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) detects and alerts on suspicious network behavior but does not actively prevent threats, relying on manual intervention for response. It also works on Network level.

 > WIPS & WIDS : (These are Works on Wifi Level)
 -----------------------------------------------
          WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) actively prevents and blocks security threats in wireless networks, automatically taking actions to stop malicious activities. 
          WIDS (Wireless Intrusion Detection System) detects and alerts on suspicious wireless network behavior but does not proactively prevent threats, requiring manual intervention for response.
