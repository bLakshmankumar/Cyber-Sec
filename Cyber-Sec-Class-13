It's continuetion class for Class-12-firewall: Here we discussing about the PROXY or WEB-GATEWAY and NIDS/NIPS concepts
========================================================================================================================

#1 PROXY or WEB-GATEWAY : 
=======================
   A proxy acts as an intermediary between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and the internet. It receives requests from clients and forwards those requests to the web servers on behalf of the clients. 
   The response from the internet/web server is then sent back to the proxy, which, in turn, delivers it to the clients.

   Proxies are commonly used for the following purposes in network security:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Anonymity and Privacy: Proxies can hide the IP addresses of clients, providing a degree of anonymity and privacy.
        Content Filtering: Proxies can filter and control the content that users access, blocking or allowing specific websites based on security policies.
        Access Control: Proxies can enforce access control policies, restricting or granting access to certain resources on the internet.
        Bandwidth Management: Proxies can cache content, optimizing bandwidth usage by serving cached content to users and reducing the need to fetch the same content repeatedly from the internet.
        Security: Proxies can provide an additional layer of security by inspecting and filtering incoming and outgoing traffic for malicious content or threats.

# Types of Proxy-servers :
==========================
    * Forward Proxy
    * Reverse Proxy

  Explanation :
  -------------
     * Forward Proxy :
     -----------------
     A forward proxy, also known as a regular proxy, is a server that sits between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and the internet. 
     It serves as an intermediary that forwards requests from clients to the internet and returns the responses to clients. 
     Forward proxies are commonly used to control access, enhance privacy, and optimize internet usage within an organization.
     Simply : When the internal users(employees) trying to access external hosted applications called as forward proxy.
     Example : Internal employee trying to access the google.com or fb.com or twitter.com
  
     Example Scenario:
     -----------------
     Suppose a corporate network deploys a forward proxy to control and monitor internet access for employees. When an employee requests access to a website, the request goes through the forward proxy. 
     The proxy can enforce access policies, filter content, and cache frequently requested resources, reducing bandwidth usage.

     * Reverse Proxy:
     ----------------
     A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and web servers, handling requests on behalf of the web servers. 
     When clients request resources, the reverse proxy forwards those requests to the appropriate web servers and returns the servers' responses to clients. 
     Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing, security, and to optimize web server performance.
     Simply : When the external users or public if they are trying to access internal facing website is called a Reverse Proxy.
     Example : External user wants to apply a job in wipro.com, for wipro company we are the external users.
    
     Example Scenario:
     -----------------
     Consider a scenario where a company hosts multiple web servers behind a reverse proxy. The reverse proxy distributes incoming requests among the web servers, providing load balancing(like nginx). 
     It also serves as a security layer, hiding the internal web servers' details and protecting them from direct exposure to the internet.

# Licencing :
=============
   How many num of end-users :
   ---------------------------
     > How many num of applications or websites or URL's
     > How many num of concurrent applications can be accessess
     > Max num of sessions
     > Max num of concurrent sessions

# Tools :
========
  Here are the couple of proxy servers :
     > ZSCALAR
     > Open DNS - CISCO
     > AKAMAI
     > Citrix
     > Fortinet

# Detection methods of proxy :
===============================
    1) Signature based   : Here EDR will allow or deny based on the signature matching.
    2) ML or Deep Learning or AI : By using this method it'll alert or allow or Block.

# How to intigrate Proxy logs to SIEM tool :
============================================
    By using syslog-server method we can intigrate proxy logs to SIEM Tool.
    Steps:
    ------
     Loginto Proxy Tool server
     Go to Settings Tab
     Click on syslog Server
     Then do below Configuration
                     SIEM-Tool-Name   SIEM-Tool-Ip-address  SIEM-Tool-Hostname   Protocal         Port                Logformat
 Example SIEM Tool:      Splunk          Splunk-server-Ip      splunk.com          TCP/UDP     514(syslogportnum)     BSD, CSV, XML 

========================================================================================================================================================================================

#2 NIDS/NIPS :
==============
   Before going to discuss about NIDS/NIPS First of all, what is an IDS or an IPS? 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A security solution that detects security-related events in your environment but does not block them. 
                                      This type of security solution may send you an alert, such as an email or text message, or log that a security event has occurred.
    Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): IPS security solution identifies a threat and blocks it so the attack cannot occur. 
                                       An IPS goes beyond the capabilities of an IDS by actively blocking or preventing identified threats in real-time.
                                       It uses similar detection mechanisms as an IDS but takes immediate action to stop or mitigate ongoing attacks.
                                       IPS can be deployed at various points in the network, including at the perimeter, between network segments, or on individual hosts.
    Comparison:
    -----------
     Detection vs Prevention: 
     ------------------------
         * IDS focuses on detecting and alerting on potential security incidents.
         * IPS not only detects but actively prevents or mitigates malicious or abnormal or suspecious threats in real-time.

     Types of IDS and IPS :
     ----------------------
        Host     : HIDS & HIPS (This concept already Discussed on EDR tool concept, When we deploy EDR tool, Bydefault EDR tool has HIDS & HIPS Capabilities, No need to deploy any additional tools to monitor.
        Network  : NIDS & NIPS 
        Wifi     : WIDS & WIPS
     
     Explanation :
     --------------
     HIDS (Host-Based Intrusion Detection System):
       Purpose: Monitors and analyzes activities on a specific computer or host to detect signs of malicious or unauthorized behavior. 
       Functionality: Provides alerts and notifications when suspicious activities are identified on an individual host.
       Action: Primarily focuses on detection and reporting, allowing administrators to investigate and respond to potential security incidents at the host level.
       Example Scenario: Notifies administrators when it detects an unusual login attempt or unauthorized file access on a specific server.

     HIPS (Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System):
       Purpose: Similar to HIDS, but with an additional capability to actively prevent or block identified threats on a specific computer or host.
       Functionality: In addition to detecting and alerting, takes immediate actions to stop or mitigate ongoing security threats at the host level.
       Action: Actively intervenes to block malicious activities in real-time, preventing potential security breaches on a specific host.
       Example Scenario: Automatically blocks network connections or specific processes associated with a known attack on a host.
     
     NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System):
       Purpose: Monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect signs of malicious or unauthorized behavior at the network level.
       Functionality: Provides alerts and notifications when suspicious network activities are identified.
       Action: Focuses on detection at the network layer, making administrators aware of potential threats affecting the entire network.
       Example Scenario: Generates an alert when it detects a pattern indicative of a known attack, such as a network scan or a specific type of malicious traffic.
 
     NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System):
       Purpose: Monitors and analyzes network traffic to actively prevent or block identified threats at the network level.
       Functionality: Combines network-level detection and prevention, actively intervening to stop malicious activities before they reach their target.
       Action: Actively blocks or prevents malicious network activities, providing a proactive defense at the network layer.
       Example Scenario: Automatically blocks network connections or filters out malicious packets before they reach the intended target within the network.

    In Summary:
    -----------
       HIDS focuses on host-level detection and alerting.
       NIDS focuses on network-level detection and alerting.
       HIPS adds active prevention capabilities at the host level.
       NIPS adds active prevention capabilities at the network level.

    # How to purchase NIDS & NIPS Licencing :
    ---------------------------------------
       Purchase the licensing based on these below use-cases
          * LAN BW or Speed
          * Netflow data information
          * Total Number of Users
          * Total Number of Sessions

    # How to deploy NIDS :
    ----------------------
       Deploy NIDS/NIPS by usning SPAN or Mirror Method. It's a copy of CS Data. If NIDS is down there is no outage or impact. But we coudn't get any incidents.
       SPAN or Mirror traffic consider as a passive Traffic.
    
    # How to Deploy NIPS :
    ----------------------
        Deploy NIDS/NIPS by usning .
