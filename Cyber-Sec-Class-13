It's continuetion class for Class-12-firewall: Concepts are PROXY or WEB-GATEWAY and NIDS/NIPS 
==============================================================================================

# PROXY or WEB-GATEWAY : 
=======================
   A proxy acts as an intermediary between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and the internet. It receives requests from clients and forwards those requests to the web servers on behalf of the clients. 
   The response from the internet/web server is then sent back to the proxy, which, in turn, delivers it to the clients.

   Proxies are commonly used for the following purposes in network security:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Anonymity and Privacy: Proxies can hide the IP addresses of clients, providing a degree of anonymity and privacy.
        Content Filtering: Proxies can filter and control the content that users access, blocking or allowing specific websites based on security policies.
        Access Control: Proxies can enforce access control policies, restricting or granting access to certain resources on the internet.
        Bandwidth Management: Proxies can cache content, optimizing bandwidth usage by serving cached content to users and reducing the need to fetch the same content repeatedly from the internet.
        Security: Proxies can provide an additional layer of security by inspecting and filtering incoming and outgoing traffic for malicious content or threats.

# Types of Proxy-servers :
==========================
    * Forward Proxy
    * Reverse Proxy

  Explination :
  -------------
     * Forward Prox :
     -----------------
     A forward proxy, also known as a regular proxy, is a server that sits between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and the internet. 
     It serves as an intermediary that forwards requests from clients to the internet and returns the responses to clients. 
     Forward proxies are commonly used to control access, enhance privacy, and optimize internet usage within an organization.
     Simply : When the internal users(employees) trying to access external hosted applications called as forward proxy.
     Example : Internal employee trying to access the google.com or fb.com or twitter.com
  
     Example Scenario:
     -----------------
     Suppose a corporate network deploys a forward proxy to control and monitor internet access for employees. When an employee requests access to a website, the request goes through the forward proxy. 
     The proxy can enforce access policies, filter content, and cache frequently requested resources, reducing bandwidth usage.

     * Reverse Proxy:
     ----------------
     A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and web servers, handling requests on behalf of the web servers. 
     When clients request resources, the reverse proxy forwards those requests to the appropriate web servers and returns the servers' responses to clients. 
     Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing, security, and to optimize web server performance.
     Simply : When the external users or public if they are trying to access internal facing website is called a Reverse Proxy.
     Example : External user wants to apply a job in wipro.com, for wipro company we are the external users.
    
     Example Scenario:
     -----------------
     Consider a scenario where a company hosts multiple web servers behind a reverse proxy. The reverse proxy distributes incoming requests among the web servers, providing load balancing(like nginx). 
     It also serves as a security layer, hiding the internal web servers' details and protecting them from direct exposure to the internet.

# Licencing :
=============
   How many num of end-users :
   ---------------------------
     > How many num of applications or websites or URL's
     > How many num of concurrent applications can be accessess
     > Max num of sessions
     > Max num of concurrent sessions


Note :
======
  > Where we can block the attacker IP-address ? on which tool ?
  --------------------------------------------------------------
       We can block the IP address on Firewall tool.

  > Where we can block the attacker Web Url ? on which tool ?
  ------------------------------------------------------------
    We can block the attacker Web Url on Web Proxy, NGFW, EDR tool.
 
  > Where we can Blocking or Port Number or allowing port number ?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
    We can Blocking or Port Number or allowing port number on Firewall tool.
