# Continuation of Information Security Class-14 Compliances :
# ===========================================================
# Onclass 14 completed about ISO 27001, Will discuss other compliances here.

1 > GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) :
==============================================
  Purpose:
  --------
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU) in May 2018.
  The primary purpose of GDPR is to enhance the protection of individuals' personal data and to provide them with greater control over how their information is collected, processed, and stored by organizations.

  Key Objectives and Purposes of GDPR:
  -----------------------------------
   * Enhanced Individual Rights:
   -----------------------------
   GDPR strengthens individuals' rights concerning their personal data. It provides individuals with more control over their information, including the right to access, rectify, and erase personal data.

   * Consent and Transparency:
   ---------------------------
   Organizations must obtain clear and explicit consent from individuals before processing their personal data. Transparency requirements ensure that individuals are informed about how their data will be used.

   * Data Breach Notification:
   ---------------------------
   GDPR introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements. Organizations are obligated to report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority and, in certain cases, to affected individuals, within a specified timeframe.

   * Data Portability:
   -------------------
   Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, facilitating the transfer of data between service providers.

   * Privacy by Design and by Default:
   -----------------------------------
   GDPR encourages organizations to integrate data protection measures into the design of their systems and processes. It also promotes default settings that prioritize privacy.

   * Accountability:
   -----------------
   Organizations are required to demonstrate compliance with GDPR. This includes maintaining records of data processing activities and conducting impact assessments for high-risk processing.

  # Problems Resolved by GDPR:
  ============================

  Inadequate Data Protection:
  ---------------------------
  Before GDPR, varying data protection laws across EU member states led to inconsistent standards and inadequate protection of individuals' data.

  Lack of Individual Control:
  ---------------------------
  Individuals often had limited control over their personal data, and organizations could process it without clear consent or proper safeguards.

  Data Breach Response:
  ---------------------
  There was a lack of standardized and mandatory procedures for reporting and addressing data breaches, which sometimes led to delayed or insufficient responses.

  Global Data Transfers:
  ----------------------
  The transfer of personal data across borders lacked a unified framework, leading to concerns about the security and privacy of data when it crossed international boundaries.

  Outdated Legislation:
  ---------------------
  Previous data protection laws were not keeping pace with the rapid advancements in technology, making it challenging to address emerging privacy concerns.

  Fragmented Regulatory Landscape:
  ---------------------------------
  Inconsistent enforcement and penalties across EU member states resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape, with varying levels of protection for individuals' data.

  GDPR addresses these issues by providing a harmonized and robust framework for data protection across the EU, enhancing individuals' rights, 
  and holding organizations accountable for the responsible and transparent processing of personal data. 
  The regulation also has implications for businesses worldwide that handle the personal data of EU residents, as it applies extraterritorially. 
  This has prompted organizations globally to reassess and strengthen their data protection practices.

  # What is GDPR Compliance?
  ==========================
  If an organization falls within the scope of GDPR, the organization must satisfy the requirements for properly processing personal data of EU residents.
    > Key requirements include:
    ---------------------------
     Establishing a legal basis for data processing:     
     ------------------------------------------------
       Organizations must have a valid legal basis for collecting and processing personal data, like fulfilling contractual or legal obligations.
     
     Obtaining explicit consent from data subjects:      
     -----------------------------------------------
       Organizations must explain how they process data in a form — most opt for a clearly-written privacy notice. 
    
     Implementing technical and organizational safeguards: 
     ------------------------------------------------------
       Organizations must implement safeguards to ensure customer data is handled securely. Safeguards may include appropriate logical access controls and conducting annual security and privacy awareness training. 
    
     Sending breach notifications:
     ------------------------------
       In the event of a data breach, organizations must notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours.
    
     Appointing a data protection officer (if applicable): 
     ------------------------------------------------------
       Certain organizations are required to appoint a data protection officer to oversee the organization’s data protection strategy and its implementation.
    
     Honoring data subject rights: 
     ------------------------------
       Data subjects have certain rights under GDPR, including the right to be informed, the right of access, and the right to object. 


   # GDPR Articles :
   =================
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) consists of 99 articles that outline the principles, rights, and obligations related to the processing of personal data. 
      Here is a summary of some key articles in GDPR:
      -----------------------------------------------
        Article 5 - Principles relating to processing of personal data:
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
          Outlines the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in data processing, as well as the purposes, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality of personal data.

        Article 6 - Lawfulness of processing:
        ------------------------------------
          Describes the legal bases for processing personal data, such as the necessity of processing for the performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, protection of vital interests, consent, the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.

        Article 9 - Processing of special categories of personal data:
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
          Details the conditions under which the processing of sensitive data (e.g., health, racial or ethnic origin) is allowed, including explicit consent, legal claims, reasons of substantial public interest, etc.

        Article 15 - Right of access by the data subject:
        -------------------------------------------------
          Grants individuals the right to obtain confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed and, if so, access to that data.

        Article 17 - Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’):
        --------------------------------------------------------
          Allows individuals to request the deletion of their personal data under specific circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected.

        Article 25 - Data protection by design and by default:
        ------------------------------------------------------
          Encourages organizations to implement data protection measures into the development of systems and services from the outset (privacy by design) and to ensure that, by default, only necessary personal data is processed (privacy by default).

        Article 30 - Records of processing activities:
        ----------------------------------------------
          Requires controllers and processors to maintain detailed records of their data processing activities.

        Article 32 - Security of processing:
        ------------------------------------
          Mandates that organizations implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

        Article 35 - Data protection impact assessment:
        -----------------------------------------------
          Requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for processing operations that are likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

        Article 37 - Designation of the data protection officer:
        --------------------------------------------------------
          Outlines the criteria for the mandatory appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) by certain controllers and processors.

        Article 44 - General principle for transfers:
        ----------------------------------------------
          Sets the general principles for transferring personal data to third countries or international organizations.

        Article 79 - Right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Establishes the right for individuals to seek legal remedies in case of a violation of their rights under GDPR.


2 > PCI DSS :
=============
    PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. 
    The standard is a collaborative effort of major credit card companies, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB, to protect sensitive cardholder data.

       Key components of PCI DSS compliance include:
       ----------------------------------------------
         Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems:
         ------------------------------------------------
           Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.

         Protect Cardholder Data:
         ------------------------
           Protect stored cardholder data. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

         Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program:
        ----------------------------------------------
           Use and regularly update anti-virus software. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

         Implement Strong Access Control Measures:
         ------------------------------------------
           Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

         Regularly Monitor and Test Networks:
         ------------------------------------
           Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. Regularly test security systems and processes.

         Maintain an Information Security Policy:
         ----------------------------------------
           Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.

3 > SOX ( Sarbanes-Oxley Act ) : [ https://www.ibm.com/topics/sox-compliance ]
================================
     SOX compliance is the act of adhering to the financial reporting, information security and auditing requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, a US law that aims to prevent corporate fraud.

     To be SOX compliant, public companies doing business in the US must: 
       - Implement internal controls to protect financial data from tampering.
       - File regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attesting to the effectiveness of security controls and the accuracy of financial disclosures. 
       - Pass an annual independent audit of their financial statements and controls. 
     The SOX Act also sets rules for the accounting firms that audit public companies and the analysts who publish research on securities. The act imposes significant fines and criminal sentences for fraudulent financial activities and certain forms of noncompliance.  
     While SOX is a financial regulation, stakeholders from throughout the organization are involved in achieving compliance. IT departments and cybersecurity teams have become particularly important as organizations increasingly turn to technology solutions to protect financial information in complex enterprise networks.  
     According to a 2023 report by consulting firm Protiviti (link resides outside ibm.com), more than half of companies say SOX compliance takes longer to achieve now. The average organization spends more than USD 1 million on SOX compliance efforts every year.  

  # How it Works : 
  ----------------
     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) works by establishing a framework of rules and regulations to enhance the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, increase transparency, and hold corporate executives and auditors accountable for their actions.
     Here's an overview of how SOX works:
     -------------------------------------
      * Establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB):
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SOX created the PCAOB as an oversight body responsible for overseeing the audits of public companies. The PCAOB sets auditing standards, conducts inspections of auditing firms, and enforces compliance with SOX.

      * Internal Control Requirements:
      --------------------------------
        SOX Section 404 requires companies to assess and report on the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. This includes the documentation of processes and controls, as well as regular testing to ensure they are functioning as intended.

      * CEO and CFO Certification:
      ----------------------------
        CEOs and CFOs of public companies are required to certify the accuracy of their company's financial statements. This certification includes affirmations that they have reviewed the financial statements, that they are accurate and complete, and that they fairly present the financial condition of the company.

      * Prohibition of Certain Activities:
      ------------------------------------
        SOX prohibits certain activities that could compromise the independence and objectivity of auditors. For example, it restricts the types of non-audit services that audit firms can provide to their clients to prevent conflicts of interest.

      * Whistleblower Protection:
      ---------------------------
        SOX includes provisions to protect whistleblowers who report potential violations of the law by their employers. Companies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who come forward with information about fraudulent activities or violations of securities laws.

      * Enhanced Financial Disclosure:
      --------------------------------
        The act requires companies to provide more comprehensive and timely financial disclosures, including information on off-balance-sheet transactions and other potential risks.

      * Penalties and Enforcement:
      -----------------------------
        SOX imposes severe penalties for non-compliance. Individuals who willfully certify false financial statements can face fines, imprisonment, or both. Additionally, companies that violate SOX provisions may be subject to fines and other legal consequences.

      * Board Composition and Independence:
      -------------------------------------
        SOX establishes rules for the composition and independence of corporate boards, particularly audit committees. It ensures that audit committees are comprised of independent directors who oversee the financial reporting process and the external audit.

      * Record Retention and Document Integrity:
      ------------------------------------------
        SOX mandates that companies maintain accurate and reliable records, including electronic communications and documents, for a specified period. This helps ensure the integrity and transparency of financial reporting.

      * Continuous Compliance and Reporting:
      --------------------------------------
        Companies must continuously comply with SOX requirements and report on their compliance in their annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Non-compliance can lead to regulatory actions and potential legal consequences.

  # Who does SOX apply to?  
  =========================
    SOX applies to all publicly traded companies doing business in the US and their wholly owned subsidiaries. It also applies to securities analysts and the accounting firms that audit public companies.
    While private companies and nonprofits are not generally bound by SOX, there are some exceptions. Private companies preparing to go public through an initial public offering are subject to SOX when they file a registration statement with the SEC.
    Whistleblowers at private companies that provide services for public companies are protected by SOX when reporting on the misconduct of their public clients.
    SOX makes it illegal for any organization—public, private or nonprofit—to destroy or falsify financial records to obstruct a federal investigation.
    While SOX is a US regulation, it does have repercussions for organizations outside the country. Public companies headquartered outside the US must abide by SOX requirements if they do business in the US. 
    The passage of SOX also inspired other countries to adopt their own laws combatting financial fraud, such as Canada’s Keeping the Promise for a Strong Economy Act (also called “C-SOX”) and Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (also called “J-SOX”).
    In Europe, many have noted significant overlap between SOX compliance and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance. In particular, many of the same security controls and data protection processes that enable SOX compliance also support GDPR compliance. 
    The European Union has implemented its own SOX-like rules surrounding the independence of financial auditors as well.

  # SOX compliance requirements : 
  ===============================
    At the core, SOX compliance means that all of an organization's financial disclosures are entirely accurate and that the organization has controls and documentation to back up its financial statements. 
    However, the process of reaching SOX compliance can be complex. SOX does not exhaustively outline every control a company needs or every step auditors must take. Different organizations reach SOX compliance in different ways.   
    At a high level, SOX has three broad requirements: 
      - Filing accurate financial reports certified by corporate executives
      - Implementing appropriate internal controls
      - Passing regular audits   

  # What is our role :
  ====================
    We should gather all these below information evidences
     - Internal Controls  - measures and processes your organization has in place to ensure everything is running smoothly, securely, and in compliance with rules and regulations.
     - Network activity   - How information moves across your organization's network.
     - Database activity  - Who is accessing your organization's databases. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can interact with and retrieve information from your databases.
     - Login activity     - Who is accessing your organization's databases. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can interact with and retrieve information from your databases.
     - User activity      - Tracking what users are doing within the system. Creating, Modifying, Deleting.
     - Information access - controlling and tracking who has access to what information. It ensures that sensitive or confidential data is only accessible to those who are authorized to view or modify it.

4 > HIPPA 
---------
   HIPAA laws are a series of federal regulatory standards outlining the lawful use and disclosure of protected health information in the United States. 
   HIPAA compliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
   HIPAA compliance is a living culture that healthcare organizations must implement within their business to protect the privacy, security, and integrity of protected health information.
   In addition to ensuring sensitive patient information is protected and secured, HIPAA compliance is critical for healthcare organizations to avoid legal and financial penalties.

  # What Is Protected Health Information? 
  ---------------------------------------
  A crucial aspect of HIPAA compliance is understanding what constitutes Protected Health Information. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Protected Health Information (PHI) refers to any individually identifiable health information held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate. This includes data in electronic, paper, or oral form. PHI encompasses medical records, billing details, treatment plans, laboratory results, insurance claims data—essentially any information related to an individual’s physical or mental health condition.
  Ensuring the protection of PHI is crucial for myriad reasons, most fundamentally, patient privacy, data security, and compliance:
    Patient Privacy: Ensuring patient confidentiality is critical to maintaining trust between healthcare providers and patients. Unauthorized access to personal health information can lead to embarrassment or stigma for individuals whose private details are exposed.
    Data Security: Healthcare organizations store vast amounts of sensitive patient data that can be lucrative targets for cybercriminals seeking financial gain through identity theft or fraud schemes. Safeguarding PHI helps prevent unauthorized access and potential breaches.
    Federal Compliance: Failure to comply with HIPAA regulations can result in severe penalties such as fines of up to $1.5 million per violation category per year (source), reputational damage, and even criminal charges.
    Maintaining the privacy and security of Protected Health Information is essential to uphold HIPAA regulations.

 # Identifiers of PHI :
 ----------------------
   HIPAA regulations outline 18 specific identifiers that must be removed from health information to render it de-identified. Some common examples include:
    - Name and address
    - Social Security number (SSN)
    - Date of birth (DOB)
    - Email addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers
    - Medical record numbers or account numbers
    - Fingerprints or facial images
    - Certificate/license numbers
    - Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
    - Health plan beneficiary numbers
    - Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers
  For a complete list of protected health information requiring de-identification under Section 164.514(a) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, view the De-Identification Standard at HHS.gov.

# HIPAA Compliance Analysis :
-----------------------------
  Healthcare providers and other entities handling PHI are moving to computerized operations. These include computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, electronic health records (EHR), and radiology, pharmacy, and laboratory systems.
  Similarly, health plans provide access to claims, care management, and self-service applications.
  While these electronic methods provide increased efficiency and interoperability, they also drastically increase the security risks of healthcare data.[7] And these new risks make HIPAA compliance more critical than ever.

  HHS details both the physical and technical safeguards that entities hosting sensitive patient data must follow:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Limited facility access and control with authorized access in place.
   - Policies about use and access to workstations and electronic media.
   - Restrictions for transferring, removing, disposing, and re-using electronic media and ePHI.
 
  Similarly, HIPAA’s technical safeguards require access control, only allowing authorized personnel to access ePHI. Access control includes:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Using unique user IDs.
   - Emergency access procedures.
   - Automatic log off.
   - Encryption and decryption.
   - Audit reports or tracking logs that record activity on hardware and software.
  Other technical policies for HIPAA compliance include implementing integrity controls or measures to confirm that electronic patient health information (ePHI) is not altered or destroyed.
  IT disaster recovery and offsite backup are vital components that ensure electronic media errors and failures are quickly remedied so that patient health information is recovered accurately and intact.

5 > CIS Hardening Benchmark : [ https://www.algosec.com/resources/cis-compliance/ ]
=============================
     A CIS (Center for Internet Security) Hardening Benchmark is a set of best practices and security configuration guidelines developed by the Center for Internet Security to secure computer systems and networks. 
     These benchmarks provide organizations with specific recommendations for configuring various software components and systems to enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of cyber threats.
     CIS benchmarks are configuration baselines and best practices for securely configuring a system. Each of the guidance recommendations references one or more CIS controls that were developed to help organizations improve their cyberdefense capabilities.
     CIS controls map to many established standards and regulatory frameworks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53, the ISO 27000 series of standards, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others.
    
     Each benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first occurs during initial development when experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts until they reach consensus on the benchmark.
     During the second phase, after the benchmark has been published, the consensus team reviews the feedback from the internet community for incorporation into the benchmark.

    CIS benchmarks provide two levels of security settings:
    -------------------------------------------------------
      Optional  - Level 1 recommends essential basic security requirements that can be configured on any system and should cause little or no interruption of service or reduced functionality.
      Mandatory - Level 2 recommends security settings for environments requiring greater security that could result in some reduced functionality.

      CIS Hardened Images are securely configured virtual machine images based on CIS Benchmarks hardened to either a Level 1 or Level 2 CIS benchmark profile. 
      Hardening is a process that helps protect against unauthorized access, denial of service, and other cyberthreats by limiting potential weaknesses that make systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.

6 > OWASP top 10 : (Open web application security project) [ https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/owasp-top-10/ ]
==========================================================
    The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
    It's an Organization or Institute it will provide the top 10 layer 7 Attacks( Application layer).

7 > NIST Framework : 
====================
    The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) provides comprehensive guidance and best practices that private sector organizations can follow to improve information security and cybersecurity risk management.

  # NIST Cybersecurity Framework core structure
  ----------------------------------------------
    NIST Cybersecurity Framework includes functions, categories, subcategories and informative references. 
    Functions give a general overview of security protocols of best practices. Functions are not intended to be procedural steps but are performed “concurrently and continuously to form an operational culture that addresses the dynamic cybersecurity risk.” 
    Categories and subcategories provide more concrete action plans for specific departments or processes within an organization. 

    Examples of NIST functions and categories include:
    ---------------------------------------------------
      - Identify: To protect against cyberattacks, the cybersecurity team needs a thorough understanding of the organization's most important assets and resources. The identify function includes categories such as asset management, business environment, governance, risk assessment, risk management strategy and supply chain risk management.
      - Protect: The protect function covers much of the technical and physical security controls for developing and implementing appropriate safeguards and protecting critical infrastructure. These categories are identity management and access control, awareness and training, data security, information protection processes and procedures, maintenance and protective technology.
      - Detect: The detect function implements measures that alert an organization to cyberattacks. Detect categories include anomalies and events, security, continuous monitoring and detection processes.
      - Respond: The respond function categories ensure the appropriate response to cyberattacks and other cybersecurity events. Specific categories include response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation and improvements.
      - Recover: Recovery activities implement plans for cyber resilience and ensure business continuity in the event of a cyberattack, security breach or other cybersecurity event. The recovery functions are recovery planning improvements and communications.
      - The NIST CSF's informative references draw a direct correlation between the functions, categories, subcategories and the specific security controls of other frameworks. These frameworks include:

        The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls®
          - COBIT 5
          - International Society of Automation (ISA) 62443-2-1:2009
          - ISA 62443-3-3:2013
          - International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission 27001:2013
          - NIST SP 800-53 Rev.4
        The NIST CSF does not tell how to inventory the physical devices and systems or how to inventory the software platforms and applications; it merely provides a checklist of tasks to complete. An organization can choose its own method on how to perform the inventory.
        If an organization needs further guidance, it can refer to the informative references to related controls in other complementary standards. There is plenty of freedom in the CSF to select the tools that best suit the cybersecurity risk management needs of an organization.

8 > ITIL (Information technology and Infrastructure Library): [ https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-itil ]
============================================================
     Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of best practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business. ITIL compliance refers to the adoption and implementation of these best practices within an organization to enhance the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of its IT services. 
     The primary purpose of ITIL is to improve IT service management processes and contribute to overall business success.

9 > QMS (ISO (9001): [ https://advisera.com/9001academy/knowledgebase/quality-management-system-what-is-it/ ]
====================
     A Quality Management System, often called a QMS, is a set of internal rules that are defined by a collection of policies, processes, documented procedures, and records. This system defines how a company will achieve the creation and delivery of the products and services they provide to their customers. When implemented in your company, the QMS needs to be specific for the product or service you provide, so it is important to tailor it to your needs. 
     However, in order to help ensure that you do not miss elements of a good system, some general guidelines exist in the form of ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management System – Requirements), which are intended to help standardize how a QMS is designed.

10 > EMS ( ISO 14001) : [ https://asq.org/quality-resources/environmental-management-system ]
=======================
     This compliance will explain about how to keep environment safe and secure.

11 > SOC 1 & SOC 2 : [ https://secureframe.com/blog/soc-1-vs-soc-2 ]
=====================
     If we wanna deploy or migrate the applications to Cloud or if we wanna deploy applications freshly on the cloud those companies has to follow SOC 1 & SOC 2 Compliances.

12 > FIPS 140-2 : [ https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/what-is-fips/ ]
=================
     This compliance will applicable to Cryptography controls by using Strong cyphers ( Cypher means Bit number or Block size).
     FIPS 140-2 is a standard which handles cryptographic modules and the ones that organizations use to encrypt data-at-rest and data-in-motion.
     FIPS 140-2 has 4 levels of security, with level 1 being the least secure, and level 4 being the most secure:
       - Level 1- Level 1 has the simplest requirements. It requires production-grade equipment, and atleast one tested encryption algorithm. This must be a working encryption algorithm, not one that has not been authorized for use.
       - Level 2- Level 2 raises the bar slightly, requiring all of level 1’s requirements along with role-based authentication and tamper evident physical devices to be used. It should also be run on an Operating System that has been approved by Common Criteria at EAL2.
       - Level 3- FIPS 140-2 level 3 is the level the majority of organizations comply with, as it is secure, but not made difficult to use because of that security. This level takes all of level 2’s requirements and adds tamper-resistant devices, a separation of the logical and physical interfaces that have “critical security parameters” enter or leave the system, and identity-based authentication. 
                  Private keys leaving or entering the system must also be encrypted before they can be moved to or from the system
       - Level 4- The most secure level of FIPS 140-2 uses the same requirements of level 3 and desires that the compliant device be able to be tamper-active and that the contents of the device be able to be erased if certain environmental attacks are detected. 
                  Another focus of FIPS 140-2 level 4 is that the Operating Systems being used by the cryptographic module must be more secure than earlier levels. If multiple users are using a system, the OS is held to an even higher standard.

13 > SABSA and TOGAF :
======================
     SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) and TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) are both enterprise architecture frameworks, but they have different focuses and applications within the field of information security and IT architecture.
