# ===========================================================
# Onclass 14 completed about ISO 27001, Will discuss other compliances here.

1 > GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) :
==============================================
  Purpose:
  --------
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation that was implemented by the European Union (EU) in May 2018.
  The primary purpose of GDPR is to enhance the protection of individuals' personal data and to provide them with greater control over how their information is collected, processed, and stored by organizations.

  Key Objectives and Purposes of GDPR:
  -----------------------------------
   * Enhanced Individual Rights:
   -----------------------------
   GDPR strengthens individuals' rights concerning their personal data. It provides individuals with more control over their information, including the right to access, rectify, and erase personal data.

   * Consent and Transparency:
   ---------------------------
   Organizations must obtain clear and explicit consent from individuals before processing their personal data. Transparency requirements ensure that individuals are informed about how their data will be used.

   * Data Breach Notification:
   ---------------------------
   GDPR introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements. Organizations are obligated to report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority and, in certain cases, to affected individuals, within a specified timeframe.

   * Data Portability:
   -------------------
   Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, facilitating the transfer of data between service providers.

   * Privacy by Design and by Default:
   -----------------------------------
   GDPR encourages organizations to integrate data protection measures into the design of their systems and processes. It also promotes default settings that prioritize privacy.

   * Accountability:
   -----------------
   Organizations are required to demonstrate compliance with GDPR. This includes maintaining records of data processing activities and conducting impact assessments for high-risk processing.

  # Problems Resolved by GDPR:
  ============================

  Inadequate Data Protection:
  ---------------------------
  Before GDPR, varying data protection laws across EU member states led to inconsistent standards and inadequate protection of individuals' data.

  Lack of Individual Control:
  ---------------------------
  Individuals often had limited control over their personal data, and organizations could process it without clear consent or proper safeguards.

  Data Breach Response:
  ---------------------
  There was a lack of standardized and mandatory procedures for reporting and addressing data breaches, which sometimes led to delayed or insufficient responses.

  Global Data Transfers:
  ----------------------
  The transfer of personal data across borders lacked a unified framework, leading to concerns about the security and privacy of data when it crossed international boundaries.

  Outdated Legislation:
  ---------------------
  Previous data protection laws were not keeping pace with the rapid advancements in technology, making it challenging to address emerging privacy concerns.

  Fragmented Regulatory Landscape:
  ---------------------------------
  Inconsistent enforcement and penalties across EU member states resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape, with varying levels of protection for individuals' data.

  GDPR addresses these issues by providing a harmonized and robust framework for data protection across the EU, enhancing individuals' rights, 
  and holding organizations accountable for the responsible and transparent processing of personal data. 
  The regulation also has implications for businesses worldwide that handle the personal data of EU residents, as it applies extraterritorially. 
  This has prompted organizations globally to reassess and strengthen their data protection practices.

  # What is GDPR Compliance?
  ==========================
  If an organization falls within the scope of GDPR, the organization must satisfy the requirements for properly processing personal data of EU residents.
    > Key requirements include:
    ---------------------------
     Establishing a legal basis for data processing:     
     ------------------------------------------------
       Organizations must have a valid legal basis for collecting and processing personal data, like fulfilling contractual or legal obligations.
     
     Obtaining explicit consent from data subjects:      
     -----------------------------------------------
       Organizations must explain how they process data in a form — most opt for a clearly-written privacy notice. 
    
     Implementing technical and organizational safeguards: 
     ------------------------------------------------------
       Organizations must implement safeguards to ensure customer data is handled securely. Safeguards may include appropriate logical access controls and conducting annual security and privacy awareness training. 
    
     Sending breach notifications:
     ------------------------------
       In the event of a data breach, organizations must notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours.
    
     Appointing a data protection officer (if applicable): 
     ------------------------------------------------------
       Certain organizations are required to appoint a data protection officer to oversee the organization’s data protection strategy and its implementation.
    
     Honoring data subject rights: 
     ------------------------------
       Data subjects have certain rights under GDPR, including the right to be informed, the right of access, and the right to object. 


   # GDPR Articles :
   =================
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) consists of 99 articles that outline the principles, rights, and obligations related to the processing of personal data. 
      Here is a summary of some key articles in GDPR:

          Establishes the right for individuals to seek legal remedies in case of a violation of their rights under GDPR.


2 > PCI DSS :
=============
    PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. 
    The standard is a collaborative effort of major credit card companies, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB, to protect sensitive cardholder data.

       Key components of PCI DSS compliance include:
       ----------------------------------------------
         Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems:
         ------------------------------------------------
           Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.

         Protect Cardholder Data:
         ------------------------
           Protect stored cardholder data. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

         Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program:
        ----------------------------------------------
           Use and regularly update anti-virus software. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

         Implement Strong Access Control Measures:
         ------------------------------------------
           Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

         Regularly Monitor and Test Networks:
         ------------------------------------
           Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. Regularly test security systems and processes.

         Maintain an Information Security Policy:
         ----------------------------------------
           Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.


3 > SOX ( Sarbanes-Oxley Act ) : [ https://www.ibm.com/topics/sox-compliance ]
================================
     SOX compliance is the act of adhering to the financial reporting, information security and auditing requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, a US law that aims to prevent corporate fraud.

     To be SOX compliant, public companies doing business in the US must: 
       - Implement internal controls to protect financial data from tampering.
       - File regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attesting to the effectiveness of security controls and the accuracy of financial disclosures. 
       - Pass an annual independent audit of their financial statements and controls. 
     The SOX Act also sets rules for the accounting firms that audit public companies and the analysts who publish research on securities. The act imposes significant fines and criminal sentences for fraudulent financial activities and certain forms of noncompliance.  
     While SOX is a financial regulation, stakeholders from throughout the organization are involved in achieving compliance. IT departments and cybersecurity teams have become particularly important as organizations increasingly turn to technology solutions to protect financial information in complex enterprise networks.  
     According to a 2023 report by consulting firm Protiviti (link resides outside ibm.com), more than half of companies say SOX compliance takes longer to achieve now. The average organization spends more than USD 1 million on SOX compliance efforts every year.  

  # How it Works : 
  ----------------
     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) works by establishing a framework of rules and regulations to enhance the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, increase transparency, and hold corporate executives and auditors accountable for their actions.
     Here's an overview of how SOX works:
     -------------------------------------
      * Establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB):
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SOX created the PCAOB as an oversight body responsible for overseeing the audits of public companies. The PCAOB sets auditing standards, conducts inspections of auditing firms, and enforces compliance with SOX.

      * Internal Control Requirements:
      --------------------------------
        SOX Section 404 requires companies to assess and report on the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. This includes the documentation of processes and controls, as well as regular testing to ensure they are functioning as intended.

      * CEO and CFO Certification:
      ----------------------------
        CEOs and CFOs of public companies are required to certify the accuracy of their company's financial statements. This certification includes affirmations that they have reviewed the financial statements, that they are accurate and complete, and that they fairly present the financial condition of the company.

      * Prohibition of Certain Activities:
      ------------------------------------
        SOX prohibits certain activities that could compromise the independence and objectivity of auditors. For example, it restricts the types of non-audit services that audit firms can provide to their clients to prevent conflicts of interest.

      * Whistleblower Protection:
      ---------------------------
        SOX includes provisions to protect whistleblowers who report potential violations of the law by their employers. Companies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who come forward with information about fraudulent activities or violations of securities laws.

      * Enhanced Financial Disclosure:
      --------------------------------
        The act requires companies to provide more comprehensive and timely financial disclosures, including information on off-balance-sheet transactions and other potential risks.

      * Penalties and Enforcement:
      -----------------------------
        SOX imposes severe penalties for non-compliance. Individuals who willfully certify false financial statements can face fines, imprisonment, or both. Additionally, companies that violate SOX provisions may be subject to fines and other legal consequences.

      * Board Composition and Independence:
      -------------------------------------
        SOX establishes rules for the composition and independence of corporate boards, particularly audit committees. It ensures that audit committees are comprised of independent directors who oversee the financial reporting process and the external audit.

      * Record Retention and Document Integrity:
      ------------------------------------------
        SOX mandates that companies maintain accurate and reliable records, including electronic communications and documents, for a specified period. This helps ensure the integrity and transparency of financial reporting.

      * Continuous Compliance and Reporting:
      --------------------------------------
        Companies must continuously comply with SOX requirements and report on their compliance in their annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Non-compliance can lead to regulatory actions and potential legal consequences.

  # Who does SOX apply to?  
  =========================
    SOX applies to all publicly traded companies doing business in the US and their wholly owned subsidiaries. It also applies to securities analysts and the accounting firms that audit public companies.
    While private companies and nonprofits are not generally bound by SOX, there are some exceptions. Private companies preparing to go public through an initial public offering are subject to SOX when they file a registration statement with the SEC.
    Whistleblowers at private companies that provide services for public companies are protected by SOX when reporting on the misconduct of their public clients.
    SOX makes it illegal for any organization—public, private or nonprofit—to destroy or falsify financial records to obstruct a federal investigation.
    While SOX is a US regulation, it does have repercussions for organizations outside the country. Public companies headquartered outside the US must abide by SOX requirements if they do business in the US. 
    The passage of SOX also inspired other countries to adopt their own laws combatting financial fraud, such as Canada’s Keeping the Promise for a Strong Economy Act (also called “C-SOX”) and Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (also called “J-SOX”).
    In Europe, many have noted significant overlap between SOX compliance and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance. In particular, many of the same security controls and data protection processes that enable SOX compliance also support GDPR compliance. 
    The European Union has implemented its own SOX-like rules surrounding the independence of financial auditors as well.

  # SOX compliance requirements : 
  ===============================
    At the core, SOX compliance means that all of an organization's financial disclosures are entirely accurate and that the organization has controls and documentation to back up its financial statements. 
    However, the process of reaching SOX compliance can be complex. SOX does not exhaustively outline every control a company needs or every step auditors must take. Different organizations reach SOX compliance in different ways.   
    At a high level, SOX has three broad requirements: 
      - Filing accurate financial reports certified by corporate executives
      - Implementing appropriate internal controls
      - Passing regular audits   

  # What is our role :
  ====================
    We should gather all these below information evidences
     - Internal Controls  - measures and processes your organization has in place to ensure everything is running smoothly, securely, and in compliance with rules and regulations.
     - Network activity   - How information moves across your organization's network.
     - Database activity  - Who is accessing your organization's databases. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can interact with and retrieve information from your databases.
     - Login activity     - Who is accessing your organization's databases. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can interact with and retrieve information from your databases.
     - User activity      - Tracking what users are doing within the system. Creating, Modifying, Deleting.
     - Information access - controlling and tracking who has access to what information. It ensures that sensitive or confidential data is only accessible to those who are authorized to view or modify it.

4 > HIPPA 
---------
   HIPAA laws are a series of federal regulatory standards outlining the lawful use and disclosure of protected health information in the United States. HIPAA compliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
