Firewall, NAT, VPN :
====================

# What is Firewall: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/]
===================
    A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.
    Accept : allow the traffic Reject : block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error” Drop : block the traffic with no reply A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the Internet.

# Genrations of the Firewall:
=============================
    Firewalls can be categorized based on their generation.
        * Packet Filtering Firewall 
        * Circuit level Gateway firewall
        * Stateful Inspection Firewall
        * Application Layer/Proxy Firewall
        * Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW)

  *Packet Filtering Firewall :
  ----------------------------
     Description : Packet filtering firewall is used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or stop based on source and destination IP address, protocols, and ports.

  *Circuit level Gateway firewall :
  ----------------------------------
     Description: Focuses on monitoring TCP handshakes to determine whether a session is legitimate.And it ensures that network sessions are initiated with the expected protocols and security policies, 
                  thereby helping to distinguish legitimate connections from potentially malicious ones.

  *Stateful Inspection Firewall :
  --------------------------------
     Description: It's a combination of Packet filtering + circuit level gateway + State of the packet, It Keeps track of the state of an active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.
                  Maintains a state table to track connections; operates at both the network and transport layers (Layers 3 and 4).

  *Application Layer Firewall(Proxy Firewalls) :
  -----------------------------------------------
     Description: Application layer firewall can inspect and filter the packets on any OSI layer, up to the application layer. 
                  It has the ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocols (like HTTP, FTP) are being misused.
                  It will act as a Bridge or Gateway beetween end user machine and also to the targeted machine and based on the policies configured it will allow and deny the traffic.

  *FW or UTM (Unified threat management) :
  -----------------------------------------
     Description: A firewall is a specific type of network security device or software that controls the flow of traffic based on predefined rules,
                  Unified Threat Management (UTM) is a broader concept that involves integrating multiple security functionalities into a unified and cohesive solution. 
                  It'll monitor inbound and outbound traffic based on the policies we configured either it'll allow the traffic or deny or block the traffic.
     Features : It's a combination of Packet filtering + Circuit level Gateway + Statefull Inspection + App level Gateway + AV+AM scanning + Basic network DLP + IDS/IPS + URL filtering or Web filtering or Bright cloud url filtering.

  *Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) :
  ------------------------------------
     Description: Next Generation Firewalls are being deployed these days to stop modern security breaches like advance malware attacks and application-layer attacks. 
                  NGFW consists of Deep Packet Inspection, Application Inspection, SSL/SSH inspection and many functionalities to protect the network from these modern threats.

     Features : Advance Threat Prevention(ATP), APT WIFI, Deep Packet Inspection, AV+Am, URL filtering, Stateful Inspection & more.

# Types of Firewall: [ https://networkinterview.com/perimeter-firewall-vs-internal-firewall/ ]
=====================
 Firewalls are generally of two types
        * Internet facing Firewall : 
             Definition: It's An external firewall, also known as a perimeter firewall, Perimeter firewalls are external firewalls which are gateway to private networks as well as other public networks such as the Internet. 
                         The external firewall monitors and protects the network from external malicious traffic, harmful programs, and intrusion attacks. 
                         Perimeter firewalls come in a variety of capabilities like some are packet filtering firewalls they inspect contents of network packet and then allow/disallow based on access control lists.
        
        * Internal Firewall :
             Definition: An internal firewall is a security solution designed to protect a network from attacks that have already gotten past the perimeter. 
                         An internal firewall protects a network from attacks which have passed the perimeter by controlling network traffic between two internal devices such as workstations and servers. 
                         An internal firewall has more complexity in terms of its application as a firewall and placed inside the internal network and employs a Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) to isolate insider attacks and reduce the impact of harm. 

# Firewall Deployment Methods :
===============================
    Deploying a firewall involves implementing the firewall solution within a network to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. 
    The specific deployment method depends on factors such as the type of firewall, network architecture, and security requirements. 
    Here are common ways to deploy a firewall:
    ------------------------------------------
       Router/NAT/Layer3 Integration Mode :  This is internet purpose
       Switch Mode or Layer2 Mode : This is Internal Purpose
       Span or Mirror method : This is For POC.
       High Availability Mode : This is For HA.

 # Firewall Zones :
 =================
       * Trust or Internal
       * DMZ or DMG
       * Untrust or External or Plublic or internet or WAN.


# Some of the FW vendors : [ https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/network-firewalls ]
==========================
    * Fortinet Firewall   * Paloalto Firewall
    * Cisco Firewall      * Juniper Firewall
    * SonicWall Firewall  * WatchGuard Firewall 
    * Sophos Firewall     * Azure Firewall & more.

# Firewall Licencing : (Licencing is ntg but a buying a product from vendor, These below are the different products that we can configure for our application security & etc).
======================
    * AV                  * DLP
    * IPS                 * URL Filtering 
    * Wifi                * Premium Support with vendor
    * AP(Access Points)   * APP Controls


# Network Address Translation (NAT) : [ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/ ]
========================================================================================================
     *WHat is NAT :
     -------------
        To access the Internet, one public IP address is needed, but we can use a private IP address in our private network. 
        The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address. To achieve this, the translation of a private IP address to a public IP address is required. 
        Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

     *Network Address Translation (NAT) Types :
     ------------------------------------------
        There are 3 ways to configure NAT: 
               1) Static NAT : Dedicated Single internal Private IP mapped to Public IP
               2) Dynamic NAT: Multiple Private IP interfaces are mapped to Public IP
               3) Port Address Translation (PAT) : Along with private internal IP If we are mapping with port number to public IP we can call PAT.

# Security Profiles : [ https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.0/best-practices/889496/security-profiles, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-security-profiles.html]
=====================
     Security profiles are a fundamental component of the security infrastructure, playing a vital role in strengthening your network against a wide array of cyberthreats.
     First we have to configure security profiles and Then we should implement these security profiles on Firewall policies/rules on inside the Policy & object option.
     If we are not enable these security profiles then firewall will not allow/block anything.

     > Top Security Profiles :
     --------------------------
         * AV                * URL Filtering 
         * DNS Filtering     * File Blocking
         * Proxy             * VOIP
         * WIfI              * SSL/SSH Inspection
         * App Control       * IPS/IDS
         * WAF               * Video Filter
      These all are the Security profiles we have to configure, After configuring these profiles We have to enble these on Policies/rules on Policy & objects option.

# Firewall Policies & Rules :
=============================
       This Firewall Policy Validation is follows Top-Bottom or Top-Down approach.
          What is Mean by Top-Bottom or Top-Down approach :
          -------------------------------------------------
             Whenever any request/packet is coming either as a inbound traffic or outbound traffic, security firewall validate that packet is satisfying the rules one by one from top to down rules, if the request packet is stisfying the rules then it'll allow the request.
             By default all traffic will be deny when we purchase a Security firewall.
         
          Conigure a Firewall Policy : 
          ----------------------------
             Here first we have to configure our business related rules based on requirment. and last we can choose the implisit deny rule(default-rule).
             If You want to block the entire application access (ex: www.facebookk.com) then we no need to configure any security-profiles, because we totally blcok that application on organization level, if someone try to access from org laptop it won't access so the employee can't perform any action.
            
           Rule ID,      Rule Name,                    SourceZone,            DestinationZone,    S.IP,    D.IP    SourceUser,  DestinUser,       Port, Protocal,  Application,         SecurityProfile,   Action,                        Log
               1      Blocking of Facebook          Trust(employee laptop)     Untrust/External   any      any       any          any             443    https     Bittorento                 -            BLOCK        no need to config anything related to log
               2      Blocking Phishing Email       Untrust zone(attacker)     Trust Zone        1.1.1.1   any       any      Internal-employee   25     smtp        Email                    -            BLOCK 
               3      Allowing Social nw websites   Trust(employees laptop)    Untrust Zone        any     any       any          any             443    https     Social Media Category  Enable-all prof  ALLOW   
               4      Blocking of Youtube           Trust(employees laptop)    Untrust Zone        any     any       any          any             443    https       Youtube                   -            BLOCK
               5      Implisit Deny(default)             any                       any             any     any       any          any             any     any          any                     -            BLOCK  

         Explination :
         =============
             1 > In 1st scenario we want to block the facebook app/web to the internal employees/endusers, So whenever internal employee type facebok.com on his laptop, browser will not accessable, bcs we block the application on firewall.
             2 > In 2nd scenario attacker was sent a phishing email to internal employee so after investigation as a temporary fix we block that attacker ip/ also will block the all other source ip's/source users for block other phiching attackers to protect all employess(D.Ip).
             3 > In 3rd scenario we want to allow the social media networks to internal employees, whenever employee trying to access the youtube.com,linkdin he can able to access, so we allow access by configurig the All Security profiles.
            *4 > In 4th scenation we want to Block the social media networks to internal employees, whenever employee trying to access the youtube.com, He can't access as per this FW profile policy.
                 Note : But employees can access the Youtube.com even we block the action on 4th rule, Because on 3rd RULE we already allow the access to all social media sites, so whenever emplyee trying to access the youtube.com firewll validate the rule, and 
                        The rule was satisfied on 3rd step itself, so it won't go to 4th step to block. bcs the security fire-wall rule is following the top down approach.
            *5 > Implisit Deny is a default firewall rule, we should place this rule on bottom of the policies list only, bcs if we update this default policy on top, while any request is come it'll deny the access by default as it's following the Top Down approach.

# High Availablity :
====================
     The primary goal of implementing high availability is to minimize downtime and ensure continuous service availability, especially for critical systems and services.
     For HA Org Maintain Two seperate machines with same Configurations. If one server/machine will compromise by attacker, we can bring up our serveice by using other servers.
     
     Here we maintain two different servers :
     -----------------------------------------
       1) Primary/active Server            2) Secondary/Passive/backup server
     Note: Please refer the NW Arch Diagram, On the network Architecture diagram where we can configure the HA.

    > If we want to maintain HA between two different types of firewalls what are the types of conditions we have to follow :
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * Both Primary and Secondary Servers/Firewall models and configurations Should be the same, If we choose both are different models it won't support for HA, bcs dependencies and configuations or different.
              Firewall model numbers should be same on both Primary and secondary servers.
            * Both Firewall Model numbers should be same.
            * Both Firewall firm Versions should be same.
    
   NOTE : > How Firewall knows which one is primary server and which one is the secondary server ?
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * Based on the Election settings firewall will act as a primary and secondary.

          > What is mean by election settings ?
          -------------------------------------
             In the context of firewall High Availability (HA), the term "election settings" typically refers to the mechanism used by the HA cluster to determine which firewall unit will take on the active or primary role and which will act as the standby or secondary unit. 
             The election process involves a set of criteria or parameters that help the firewalls in the cluster make a decision on which unit should be the active one. 
             Alway Primary firewall score or election is greater than the secondary.

# Firewall Upgrade :
====================
     Regular firewall updates provide crucial patches, enhancements, and new features that strengthen defense mechanisms, ensuring the organization's resilience against emerging cyber risks.
     Frequent upgrades of firewalls are essential in cybersecurity to ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats and vulnerabilities. 
     Cyber adversaries constantly develop new attack techniques, exploits, and malware, requiring firewall vendors to release updates and patches to address these emerging risks.
     Ex: 7.1.1 to 7.1.2 (Major.Minor.Patch).
         > While Performing the Server Upgardations, First we should break the primary and secondary connection, Then we should upgrade the primary server, Once Primary server uupgarded to latest version Then we should validating the service availability & performance for 2 days.
           Once everything is working as we expected after upgrading the primary firewall, Then only we should Upgrade the secondary firewall to the latest version.
         > If we dissconnect the cable/connection while upgrading the primary server, Then the secondary server will automatically act as a primary server.
 
* Steps taken Before upgrading the Firewall version in simply :
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
     * Disconnect the both firewall and High availability.
     * Make secondary firewall as primary and continue the business operations.
     * Upgrade the Disconnected firewall to latest version.
     * Monitor the upgrded firewall for one or two days to verify performance related issues and also apllication compatability issues.
     * Once everything working as expected then start upgrade the secondary firewall.
     * Bringing it Back to HA.

# What should we do if both HA servers were went down :
=======================================================
     * Handling a situation where both High Availability (HA) servers have gone down requires careful planning and consideration of disaster recovery measures.
     * Determine whether the issue is with the servers themselves, the network, or other infrastructure components.
     * Establish clear communication channels to keep relevant stakeholders informed about the situation.
     * Identify the root cause of the simultaneous failure. This may involve examining logs, monitoring systems, and conducting a post-mortem analysis to understand what happened.
     * If the primary High Availability servers are unrecoverable, activate the organization's Disaster Recovery (DR) plan. This may involve promoting backup servers, shifting operations to a secondary data center, or utilizing cloud-based resources.
     * Restore from Backups:  If data is intact, initiate the process of restoring services from backups. This may involve reinstalling applications, configurations, and databases to bring systems back to a functional state.

# What is VPN [Virtual Private Network] : [ https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-a-vpn, https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn]
=========================================
     VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using a public networks. VPNs encrypt the internet traffic and disguise our online identity. 
     This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. The encryption takes place in real time.
     VPN server or firewall uses the selfsighned certificate or Purchased CA. Certificate will be exchanged between firewall or vpn server to enduser machine(employee machine).

   > How VPN Works in Bakend :
    --------------------------
       * Encryption:      When a user connects to a VPN, the data is encrypted before it travels over the internet. This encryption ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains secure and unreadable without the proper decryption key.
       * Tunneling:       VPNs use a process called tunneling to encapsulate the data in a secure "tunnel" as it traverses the internet. This prevents unauthorized access and protects the data from potential threats.
       * Authentication:  Users or devices connecting to the VPN must undergo an authentication process to verify their identity. This is typically done through usernames, passwords, or more secure methods like digital certificates.
       * Secure Connection: Once authenticated, the user establishes a secure connection to the VPN server. This connection can be initiated using various protocols, each offering different levels of security and functionality.
   
   > VPN Port and Protocal :
   --------------------------
       * Port num of VPN = 500
       * Protocal of VPN = IPsec(Internet protocal security).

   > Types of VPN : [ https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/types-of-vpn ] 
   ================
       There are two main types of VPN that people can use to securely connect to corporate networks. 
          1. Remote Access VPN
          2. Site-to-site VPN
       > Explination :
       ---------------
          1. Remote Access VPN :
          ----------------------
          Allows individual users to connect to a private network from a remote location over the internet. Commonly used for remote workers accessing corporate resources.     
             Remote Access VPN Contains Different Componenets those are : 
               In a Remote Access VPN setup, several components work together to enable secure and private communication for remote users connecting to a corporate network. 
                  * VPN Client : A VPN client is a software application or program installed on the device of a remote user/end user machine (such as a laptop, desktop, or mobile device). 
                                 This software allows the user's device to establish a secure connection to the corporate network or VPN gateway.
                      Functionality:
                         The VPN client initiates the VPN connection.
                         It handles the encryption and encapsulation of data before sending it over the internet.
                         Provides a user interface for configuring connection settings and managing the VPN connection.
                      Example: Cisco AnyConnect, OpenVPN client, Microsoft VPN client.
    
                  * VPN Portal : A VPN portal, also known as a WebVPN or SSL VPN portal, is a web-based interface that allows users to access the VPN services through a web browser. It contains the list of the Gateways or Routers Information.
                      Functionality:
                         Users log in to the VPN portal using a web browser.
                         The portal provides a gateway to various VPN services and resources.
                         Users may have access to a range of applications, files, and other network resources through the portal.
                      Advantages :
                         No need to install a dedicated VPN client on the user's device.
                         Accessible from any device with a web browser.
                         Simplifies user access to VPN services.
                      Example: Cisco WebVPN, Juniper SSL VPN, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect.
                  
                  * VPN Gateway : A VPN gateway, also known as a VPN concentrator or VPN server, is the central component that manages and establishes secure connections between remote users and the corporate network.
                      Functionality:
                         Receives connection requests from VPN clients.
                         Authenticates users and establishes a secure tunnel for data transmission.
                         Routes encrypted traffic between remote users and the internal network.
                         Manages encryption, decryption, and other security-related functions.
                      Types:
                         Hardware VPN Gateway: Dedicated hardware devices designed to handle VPN connections.
                         Software VPN Gateway: Software-based solutions running on general-purpose servers or appliances.
                      Example: Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance), Juniper Networks SRX Series, OpenVPN Server.
