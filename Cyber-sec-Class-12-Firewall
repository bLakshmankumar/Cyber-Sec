Firewall Class :
================

# What is Firewall: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/]
===================
    A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.
    Accept : allow the traffic Reject : block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error” Drop : block the traffic with no reply A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the Internet.

# Genrations of the Firewall:
=============================
    Firewalls can be categorized based on their generation.
        * Packet Filtering Firewall 
        * Circuit level Gateway firewall
        * Stateful Inspection Firewall
        * Application Layer/Proxy Firewall
        * Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW)

  *Packet Filtering Firewall :
  ----------------------------
     Description : Packet filtering firewall is used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or stop based on source and destination IP address, protocols, and ports.

  *Circuit level Gateway firewall :
  ----------------------------------
     Description: Focuses on monitoring TCP handshakes to determine whether a session is legitimate.And it ensures that network sessions are initiated with the expected protocols and security policies, 
                  thereby helping to distinguish legitimate connections from potentially malicious ones.

  *Stateful Inspection Firewall :
  --------------------------------
     Description: It's a combination of Packet filtering + circuit level gateway + State of the packet, It Keeps track of the state of an active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.
                  Maintains a state table to track connections; operates at both the network and transport layers (Layers 3 and 4).

  *Application Layer Firewall(Proxy Firewalls) :
  -----------------------------------------------
     Description: Application layer firewall can inspect and filter the packets on any OSI layer, up to the application layer. 
                  It has the ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocols (like HTTP, FTP) are being misused.
                  It will act as a Bridge or Gateway beetween end user machine and also to the targeted machine and based on the policies configured it will allow and deny the traffic.

  *FW or UTM (Unified threat management) :
  -----------------------------------------
     Description: A firewall is a specific type of network security device or software that controls the flow of traffic based on predefined rules,
                  Unified Threat Management (UTM) is a broader concept that involves integrating multiple security functionalities into a unified and cohesive solution. 
                  It'll monitor inbound and outbound traffic based on the policies we configured either it'll allow the traffic or deny or block the traffic.
     Features : It's a combination of Packet filtering + Circuit level Gateway + Statefull Inspection + App level Gateway + AV+AM scanning + Basic network DLP + IDS/IPS + URL filtering or Web filtering or Bright cloud url filtering.

  *Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) :
  ------------------------------------
     Description: Next Generation Firewalls are being deployed these days to stop modern security breaches like advance malware attacks and application-layer attacks. 
                  NGFW consists of Deep Packet Inspection, Application Inspection, SSL/SSH inspection and many functionalities to protect the network from these modern threats.

     Features : Advance Threat Prevention(ATP), APT WIFI, Deep Packet Inspection, AV+Am, URL filtering, Stateful Inspection & more.

# Types of Firewall: [ https://networkinterview.com/perimeter-firewall-vs-internal-firewall/ ]
=====================
 Firewalls are generally of two types
        * Internet facing Firewall : 
             Definition: It's An external firewall, also known as a perimeter firewall, Perimeter firewalls are external firewalls which are gateway to private networks as well as other public networks such as the Internet. 
                         The external firewall monitors and protects the network from external malicious traffic, harmful programs, and intrusion attacks. 
                         Perimeter firewalls come in a variety of capabilities like some are packet filtering firewalls they inspect contents of network packet and then allow/disallow based on access control lists.
        
        * Internal Firewall :
             Definition: An internal firewall is a security solution designed to protect a network from attacks that have already gotten past the perimeter. 
                         An internal firewall protects a network from attacks which have passed the perimeter by controlling network traffic between two internal devices such as workstations and servers. 
                         An internal firewall has more complexity in terms of its application as a firewall and placed inside the internal network and employs a Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) to isolate insider attacks and reduce the impact of harm. 

# Firewall Deployment Methods :
===============================
    Deploying a firewall involves implementing the firewall solution within a network to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. 
    The specific deployment method depends on factors such as the type of firewall, network architecture, and security requirements. 
    Here are common ways to deploy a firewall:
    ------------------------------------------
       Router/NAT/Layer3 Integration Mode :  This is internet purpose
       Switch Mode or Layer2 Mode : This is Internal Purpose
       Span or Mirror method : This is For POC.
       High Availability Mode : This is For HA.

 # Firewall Zones :
 =================
       * Trust or Internal
       * DMZ or DMG
       * Untrust or External or Plublic or internet or WAN.

# Network Address Translation (NAT) : [ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/ ]
========================================================================================================
     *WHat is NAT :
     -------------
        To access the Internet, one public IP address is needed, but we can use a private IP address in our private network. 
        The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address. To achieve this, the translation of a private IP address to a public IP address is required. 
        Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

     *Network Address Translation (NAT) Types :
     ------------------------------------------
        There are 3 ways to configure NAT: 
               1) Static NAT : Dedicated Single internal Private IP mapped to Public IP
               2) Dynamic NAT: Multiple Private IP interfaces are mapped to Public IP
               3) Port Address Translation (PAT) : Along with private internal IP If we are mapping with port number to public IP we can call PAT.

# Security Profiles : [ https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.0/best-practices/889496/security-profiles, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-security-profiles.html]
---------------------
     Security profiles are a fundamental component of the security infrastructure, playing a vital role in strengthening your network against a wide array of cyberthreats.
