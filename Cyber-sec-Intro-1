Security & Definition :
=======================
Software/IT Definition : Protecting of data, App, DB's, Servers, Assets and Cloud information from any damage.
Protecting entair organizatioin related to data, related to assets, related to servers, related to Dbs and etc.
In general most of the hacking will happen through internet.

What is threat actor:
=====================
Threat actor is nothing but an attacker. who ever do trying to hack that is called treat actor.

Attacker/Hacker/Intruders/Threat Actor Aim/ Objectives :(main objectives)
=========================================================================
1. Easy way to earning money.
2. Stealing of Data.

Hacker Types :
=============
There are 3 types of hacker/attackers/threat actors those 3 are
 1. Black Hat - Real hackers - Will compromise the system/app/db/server/cloud > finally they ask money.
 2. White Hat - Ethical Security hackers-fixing the issues and vulnerabilities.(These are we can call attacker/ threat-actor/Intruders). whatever the hacking the Black-Hat hacker doing The White-Hat hackers will fixing those issue or vulnerabilities.  
 3. Grey Hat  - In between Black and White - They aren't malicious, but they are not always ethical either.

Note: Black-Hat hackers are Offensive, White-hat hackers are Defensive.

Branches or Subdomains of security:
===================================
There are different types of security technologies we have.
1. Information Security 
2. Physical Security 
3. Endpoint Security
4. Network Security
5. Application Security
6. Cloud Security
7. Product Security
8. Cyber Security (SIEM, SOC) & VAPT (ATTACKER)-Black-Box, Grey, WhiteBox, SAST(Code reviews) And DAST.
9. Infra Security.

Explanation :
=============
1) Information Security : (Collection of data)
==============================================
    Meaning: Information security, physical security, Endpoint security, Network Security these all are the lagacy securties. lagacy is ntg but a old technology means it's existing from long.
 > We have 4 sub-types of Information security :
 -----------------------------------------------
    1. GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance).
    2. Implimentation of IS-ISO 27001 (IS - Information Security).
    3. Risk Management- Assesment, Risk mitigation, Risk Transfer(Insurance), Avoidance.
    4. Incident Response (BCP(Business continues planning) & DR (Disaster Recovery)). 
    Purpose: Ensure that sensitive and valuable information is secure from unauthorized access or modifications, preserving the trust and reliability of data.
    Examples : Encryption, access controls, authentication mechanisms, and security policies.

2) Physical Security :
======================
    Meaning: Physical security involves measures and mechanisms to protect physical assets, facilities, and resources from unauthorized access, damage, or harm. 
    This can include security guards, surveillance cameras, access controls, and secure building designs.
    Examples: Surveillance systems, access control systems, security guards, and biometric access systems

3) Endpoint Security:
=====================
    Meaning: Employee is the end user for every organization, he/she uses the organization devices, SO Endpoint security focuses on securing individual devices (endpoints) such as computers, laptops, and mobile devices. 
    It involves antivirus software, firewalls, and other measures to protect endpoints from cyber threats.
    Purpose: Safeguarding the devices that connect to a network to prevent potential security breaches and the spread of threats.
    Examples: Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR), firewalls, Anti Malware, HIDS/HIPS, DLP(Data loss/leak prevention), and mobile device management (MDM) solutions & etc.

4) Network Security:
====================
    Meaning: Network security is the practice of securing a computer network infrastructure against unauthorized access, disruptions, or misuse.
    It involves the implementation of measures to protect data during transmission and prevent unauthorized access to the network.
    Purpose: Safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data as it travels across networks.
    Examples: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and network segmentation.
